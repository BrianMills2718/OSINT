The FSB and GRU coordinated Operation Nightfall in Eastern Ukraine during July 2014. Colonel Igor Petrov (FSB) and Major Sergei Ivanov (GRU) led the operation from Moscow, with direct support from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade based in Kursk. The operation utilized a Buk missile system, which was transported from Russia to Ukraine to support separatist forces in Donetsk.

## Key Personnel and Organizations

### Russian Intelligence Services

The operation involved cooperation between two major Russian intelligence agencies: the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Colonel Igor Petrov served as the FSB operational commander, while Major Sergei Ivanov represented GRU interests. Both operatives reported directly to Moscow headquarters and coordinated their activities through secure channels.

Lieutenant Oleg Markov (FSB) and Agent Anna Volkova (FSB) provided tactical support to Colonel Petrov throughout the operation. On the GRU side, Captain Dmitri Sokolov from Unit 29155 worked alongside Major Ivanov to coordinate military assets. These six operatives formed the core command structure that executed Operation Nightfall.

### Military Units

The 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade played a crucial role in Operation Nightfall. Based in Kursk, the brigade provided the Buk missile system that became central to the operation. Colonel Petrov and Major Ivanov personally coordinated with 53rd Brigade commanders to arrange transport of the Buk from Kursk to the Ukrainian border.

## Geographic Network

### Russian Territory

Moscow served as the primary command center for Operation Nightfall, with both FSB and GRU headquarters directing Colonel Petrov and Major Ivanov. Kursk housed the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade and served as the Buk missile system's origin point. Rostov-on-Don functioned as the forward operational base where Colonel Petrov, Major Ivanov, Lieutenant Markov, and Captain Sokolov coordinated deployment logistics.

### Ukrainian Territory

Donetsk became the primary operational theater for Operation Nightfall. The Buk missile system, accompanied by Lieutenant Markov and Captain Sokolov, operated in the Donetsk region under FSB and GRU command. Colonel Petrov and Major Ivanov maintained oversight from Rostov while coordinating with separatist forces in Donetsk.

## Organizational Relationships

The cooperation between FSB and GRU in Operation Nightfall demonstrated unprecedented coordination between Russian intelligence services. Colonel Igor Petrov (FSB) and Major Sergei Ivanov (GRU) established a joint command structure that integrated military assets from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade with intelligence operations. Lieutenant Oleg Markov, Agent Anna Volkova, Captain Dmitri Sokolov, and Unit 29155 all contributed to the unified operational framework.

## Media and Intelligence Sharing

Twitter and VKontakte served as primary sources for open-source intelligence on Operation Nightfall. Bellingcat and The Insider extensively analyzed social media posts from these platforms. Eliot Higgins pioneered techniques for tracking the Buk missile system through Twitter geotagging, while Christo Grozev identified key VKontakte accounts linked to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade and Unit 29155.

## Conclusion

Operation Nightfall represents a coordinated effort between FSB and GRU, led by Colonel Igor Petrov and Major Sergei Ivanov, to deploy military assets from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade in support of separatist operations. The investigation by Bellingcat, The Insider, Eliot Higgins, and Christo Grozev documented the Buk missile system's movement from Kursk through Rostov to Donetsk, revealing the extensive coordination between Russian intelligence services, military units, and separatist forces.
