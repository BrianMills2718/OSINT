# Wiki Planning Files - MOVED

**Date Moved**: 2025-11-18

**New Location**: `/home/brian/projects/investigative_wiki/`

## Why This Was Moved

These wiki planning documents were originally created in the `sam_gov` repository but have been moved to their own dedicated project for the following reasons:

1. **Separate Concerns**: The investigative journalism wiki is a distinct project from the SAM.gov multi-source search platform
2. **Different Scope**: The wiki focuses on general web research (Brave/Tavily + GPT-Researcher), while sam_gov focuses on government databases (SAM, DVIDS, USAJobs) and social media
3. **Avoid Confusion**: Keeping them in the same repo led to confusion about whether they were related projects

## What Was Moved

All files from this directory have been copied to `/home/brian/projects/investigative_wiki/`:
- `v3_INTEGRATED_FUTURE.md` - Main V1 design document (with consultant edits)
- `v3_STANDALONE.md` - Standalone version
- `poc/` - Stage 1-3 validation materials
- `test_data/` - Supporting files

## Original Context

These files were created 2025-11-14 to 2025-11-16 as part of planning an investigative journalism wiki system with:
- Entity extraction from research
- Knowledge graph storage
- Lead-based investigation organization
- Ultra-minimal phased validation (Stage 1 → 2 → 3 → Full PoC → V1)
