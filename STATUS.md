| **ParallelExecutor Integration** | [PASS] | Uses execute_all() method correctly, flattens Dict[db_id, QueryResult] → List[Dict] | None | Ready for BooleanMonitor integration |
| **AdaptiveBooleanMonitor Integration** | [PASS] | monitoring/adaptive_boolean_monitor.py created (269 lines), full E2E test complete: 19 results, 14 relevant, email sent | ~3.5 min total (84s adaptive search + 101s relevance filtering + email) | Ready for production use |

**Phase 1.5 Week 1 Status**: 7 of 7 components working (100%)

**Evidence** (AdaptiveSearchEngine test - 2025-10-20):

API: No key required, free access
Multi-source test: 20 total results (10 DVIDS + 10 Federal Register)
```

**Evidence** (Production Email Delivery - 2025-10-19 17:50):
```
SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com:587
Authentication: Successful (Gmail app password)
Email sent: [Test Monitor] - 10 new results

```

**Evidence** (LLM Relevance Filtering - 2025-10-19 18:48):
```
Test: Domestic Extremism Monitor ("NVE" keyword)
Results found: 4 results containing "NVE"
- "Star Spangled Sailabration" → 0/10 (not relevant)
- "Star Spangled Sailabration" → 0/10 (not relevant)
- "War of 1812 Baltimore" → 0/10 (not relevant)
- "War of 1812 Baltimore" → 0/10 (not relevant)

Action: No alert sent (all filtered out)
Validation: ✅ System correctly prevents false positives
```

**Evidence** (Keyword Curation - 2025-10-19 18:00):
```
Automated Extraction Analysis:

Article Tag Analysis:
- 3,300 tags from Ken Klippenstein & Bill's Black Box articles
- Top topics: national security (130x), civil liberties (92x), surveillance (54x)

Manual Curation Result:
- ~100 high-value investigative keywords extracted
- Tier 1: FBI classifications, specific programs (e.g., "Nihilistic Violent Extremism", "FISA warrant")
- Tier 2: Agencies, concepts (e.g., "JSOC", "inspector general report")
- Archived flawed automated extraction to archive/2025-10-19/
```

**Evidence** (Boolean Query Testing - 2025-10-19 20:52):
```
Test: Boolean Test Monitor (6 keywords, 2 sources)
Keywords tested:
- Simple: "cybersecurity", "FISA"

---

## Phase 0 COMPLETE - Evidence

### ✅ Streamlit UI Working

**Command**:
```bash
streamlit run apps/unified_search_app.py
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ UI launches successfully at http://localhost:8501
- ✅ All 4 tabs load without import errors:
  - ClearanceJobs (uses Playwright scraper)
  - DVIDS (uses API integration)
  - SAM.gov (uses API integration)
  - AI Research (uses agentic executor)
- ✅ Tab modules copied from experiments/scrapers/ and updated
- ✅ ClearanceJobs tab updated to use Playwright instead of deprecated library

**Files Updated**:
- Copied: experiments/scrapers/*.py → apps/*.py
- Modified: apps/clearancejobs_search.py (now uses clearancejobs_playwright.py)

**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 (Boolean Monitoring MVP)

### ✅ Discord Integration Working (2025-10-19)

**Command**:
```bash
python3 test_discord_cli.py "ukraine intelligence"
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Integration registered in registry with ID "discord"
- ✅ Category: social_general (first social media source)
- ✅ Search test: 777 results in 978ms
- ✅ Keyword extraction working: ["ukraine", "intelligence"]
- ✅ Results include server, channel, author, timestamp, matched keywords
- ✅ No API key required (searches local exports)
- ⚠️ 4 corrupted JSON files detected (skipped automatically)

**Results Sample**:
```
Server: Project Owl: The OSINT Community
Channel: russia-ukraine-spec
Author: dan0010940
Content: https://meduza.io/en/news/2025/09/25/ukraine-planning-new-offensive...
Matched keywords: ['ukraine', 'intelligence']
Score: 1.00
```

**Files Created**:
- integrations/social/discord_integration.py (322 lines)
- integrations/social/__init__.py
- test_discord_cli.py (test script)

**Data Available**:
- Bellingcat server: 479 files, 16 MB, 35 days of history
- Project OWL server: Partial export (some files corrupted)
- Location: data/exports/

**Next Steps**:
- Fix corrupted JSON files from interrupted exports
- Consider SQLite FTS5 indexing for faster search (Phase 3A optimization)
- Add Discord to Boolean monitors (optional)

## Evidence-Based Assessment

**What We KNOW Works** (tested with evidence):
1. DVIDS API: 1000 results in 1.1s ✅
2. USAJobs API: 3 results in 3.6s ✅
3. Playwright: Installed with chromium ✅
4. Virtual environment: All dependencies installed ✅
5. Cost tracking: Infrastructure ready ✅

**What We DON'T KNOW Yet**:
1. Does the Streamlit UI actually work?
2. Does agentic executor work end-to-end?
3. Does ClearanceJobs integration work through UI?
4. What is SAM.gov rate limit status?

**What We KNOW Doesn't Work**:
1. FBI Vault: Cloudflare 403 blocking 🚫

---

## Next Session Actions

**Before building anything new**:

1. **Run Streamlit UI** - `streamlit run apps/unified_search_app.py`
2. **Test each tab** - ClearanceJobs, DVIDS, SAM.gov, AI Research
3. **Document what works** - Update this file with evidence
4. **Document what doesn't** - Update this file with errors

**Then decide**:
- If UI works → Phase 0 COMPLETE, begin Phase 1
- If UI broken → Fix issues, retest
- If UI works but missing features → Decide: fix or defer to Phase 1

---

## Discovery Protocol Compliance

✅ **Read CLAUDE.md TEMPORARY** - Current task is ClearanceJobs completion
✅ **Read STATUS.md** - This file, now updated with reality
✅ **Check directory structure** - Matches CLAUDE.md expectations
✅ **Test existing entry points** - Streamlit UI exists, MUST TEST NEXT
❌ **Tested user-facing entry points** - NOT YET DONE - NEXT TASK

**Next Step**: Test `streamlit run apps/unified_search_app.py` before building anything else.
