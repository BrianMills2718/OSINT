DVIDS: Decomposed query found 50 unique results across 5 terms

Executing Step: Call search.php (Reason: Twitter is relevant for real-time announcements, expert commentary, and public discussion about military cyber ranges and exercises. The query captures common phrase variants and wargame/training terms, restricts to military/defense actors (DoD, USCYBERCOM, NATO, service names) and excludes gaming/esports noise. Using Latest and 3 pages (~60 tweets) balances recency with breadth.)

Executing Step: Call search.php (Reason: Twitter is relevant for this research because it surfaces real-time discussion, official announcements (service cyber commands, DoD), expert commentary, news about exercises/changes to curricula, and reports/leaks. I chose a query that combines program/training terms (training, curriculum, cyber range, CTF, red/blue team) with military/agency identifiers (DoD, USCYBERCOM, service cyber units, NATO/CCDCOE). I excluded job/hiring results to reduce recruitment posts. "Latest" is selected to capture recent developments and real-time discussion; 3 pages (~60 tweets) balances breadth with manageability.)

Executing Step: Call search.php (Reason: Relevant = true because Twitter is useful for finding company accounts, announcements, press releases and expert commentary about organizations that provide military/defense cyber training. The query combines exact phrases for training products (e.g., "military cybersecurity training", "cyber range") with defense-related terms (DoD, military) and supplier/business terms (company, provider, contractor) to surface corporate accounts and posts about providers while excluding hiring/job noise.)

The query combines phrases for training and measurement terms, includes major organizations (DoD, services, NATO) to find program-specific posts, and excludes hiring/recruitment terms to reduce job-post noise.
