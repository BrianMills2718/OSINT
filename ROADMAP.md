### Tasks

1. **Build Boolean Monitor**:
   - [x] Load keyword database from YAML configs
   - [x] Schedule daily searches (APScheduler)
   - [x] Implement deduplication logic (SHA256 hashing)
   - [x] Email alerts (Gmail SMTP with HTML formatting)

2. **Add new government sources**:
   - [x] Federal Register adapter (415 lines)
   - [ ] FBI Vault adapter - DEFERRED (Cloudflare 403 blocking)
   - [ ] Congress.gov adapter - DEFERRED (not critical for MVP)

3. **Create monitoring config files**:
   - [x] 5 production monitors configured:
     - domestic_extremism_monitor.yaml (8 keywords)
     - surveillance_fisa_monitor.yaml (9 keywords)
     - special_operations_monitor.yaml (9 keywords)

### Decision Points

**Phase 5 vs Iterate?**

After Phase 4 (week 12), you'll have:
- ✅ Automated monitoring with alerts
- ✅ Natural language research interface
- ✅ Multi-source search (gov + social)
- ✅ AI analysis and synthesis

**Option A**: Build full team UI (Phase 5)
- Pros: True team collaboration, polished UX

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Start with Real Use Cases
- Don't build for hypothetical needs
- Use actual investigations as test cases
- Let usage drive feature priorities

### 2. Get Team Feedback Early
- Deploy Streamlit UI (Phase 2) quickly
- Have team use it for real work
- See what they actually need vs assumptions

### 3. Don't Over-Engineer
- Streamlit is fine for internal tools
- Don't need React if Streamlit works
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

### 4. Budget for LLM Costs
- Can add up quickly
- Cache aggressively
- Use cheaper models where possible (gpt-5-nano, gpt-4o-mini)

### 5. Document as You Go
- Future maintainability
- Team onboarding
- API docs for power users

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-10-18 | Use Playwright instead of official ClearanceJobs API | Official API broken (returns all 57k jobs) | Slower (5-8s) but accurate |
| 2025-10-18 | Add gpt-5-nano support | Cost optimization (~10x cheaper than gpt-5-mini) | Lower costs for simple queries |
| 2025-10-18 | Implement cost tracking with LiteLLM | Track LLM spend across models | Better budget management |
| 2025-10-19 | Add LLM relevance filtering to monitors | Prevent false positives from keyword matching | Reduces noise, only alerts on relevant results |
| 2025-10-19 | Implement parallel search execution | Sequential searches took 5-6 minutes | 10x speedup (30-60s for 32 searches) |
| 2025-10-19 | Defer FBI Vault and Congress.gov | FBI Vault blocked by Cloudflare, Congress.gov not critical | Focus on working sources first |
| 2025-10-19 | Curate keywords manually vs automated extraction | Automated extraction had quality issues (possessives, filler words) | Higher quality monitors with ~100 curated keywords |

## Next Review

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Focus**: Phase 1 validation and production deployment
**Participants**: Brian (lead developer)

**Agenda**:
1. Test Boolean query support (quoted phrases, AND/OR/NOT operators)
2. Run full production monitor end-to-end test
3. Deploy scheduler for automated daily monitoring
4. Monitor results for 1-2 weeks and tune keywords
5. Decide: Begin Phase 2 (Web UI) or continue optimizing Phase 1
