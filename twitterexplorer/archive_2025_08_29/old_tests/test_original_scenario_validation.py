"""
Final Validation Test - Original Failing Scenario Resolution

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT: This test validates resolution of the core architectural problem
described in CLAUDE.md:

BEFORE FIX:
- Investigation system stuck in primitive search loops  
- 100+ searches with patterns like "find different 2024" repeated 40+ times
- 0.000% satisfaction always (satisfaction scoring was broken)
- 0 accumulated findings consistently (findings integration was broken)
- Quantity-based effectiveness scoring (59 irrelevant results = 4.5/10 score)

AFTER FIX:
- Intelligent investigation termination when satisfaction reached
- Semantic relevance evaluation working
- Accumulated findings > 0 for relevant results
- Satisfaction > 0.0% when investigation succeeds
- End-to-end integration chain functional

This is the definitive test that the core problems described in CLAUDE.md are resolved.

    This simulates the exact conditions that were failing before:
    - Complex investigation query requiring multiple perspectives  
    - System must terminate intelligently rather than infinite loops
    - Satisfaction must be calculable and > 0.0% for successful investigations
    - Findings must accumulate from LLM evaluation
