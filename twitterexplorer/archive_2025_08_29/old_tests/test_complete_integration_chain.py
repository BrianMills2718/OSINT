"""
Test Complete Integration Chain - End-to-End Findings Integration

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT: This test verifies the complete integration chain:
1. LLM Evaluation -> FindingAssessment objects
2. FindingAssessment -> DataPoint creation
3. DataPoint -> Finding object creation
4. Finding -> session.accumulated_findings accumulation 
5. Accumulated findings -> satisfaction calculation > 0.0%

This addresses the core architectural failure identified in CLAUDE.md
