Rationale: the new items increase the volume, recency, and visibility of the same claim, increasing confidence that this claim is being widely reported and attributed to the Congressional clip. However, they do not on their own resolve authenticity, provenance, or independent sensor/weapon telemetry corroboration, so the increase is incremental rather than transformational.

This is additional public amplification and repetition of the same primary claim, increasing the weight of social corroboration (reach and repetition) but not introducing independent primary-source verification (no raw sensor footage, telemetry, or third-party corroborating sensors).
