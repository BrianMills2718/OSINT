# CODEBASE DECLUTTER ANALYSIS

## FILES TO ARCHIVE (Created by me that violate "no fallbacks" rule)

### My Fallback System (VIOLATES CORE PRINCIPLE):
- `llm_investigation_coordinator.py` - My unused fallback coordinator
- `investigation_prompts.py` - Only used by my fallback system
- `test_llm_investigation_coordinator.py` - Tests for unused fallback

### Debug/Validation Scripts (Temporary, no longer needed):
- `debug_llm_responses.py`
- `test_fixed_coordinator.py` 
- `test_phase4_integration.py`
- `test_all_success_criteria.py`
- `test_final_validation.py`
- `test_my_coordinator_only.py`
- `test_honest_assessment.py`
- `fix_assessment_generation.py`

### Result Files from Invalid Testing:
- `final_validation_success.json` - Success based on wrong system
- `assessment_comparison.json`
- `datapoint_diagnostic.json`
- `state_comparison.json`

## FILES TO KEEP (Actual value):

### Bug Fixes to PRIMARY system:
- Modified `finding_evaluator_llm.py` - Fixed real input validation bug
- Modified `investigation_engine.py` - Added API key configuration (if beneficial)

### Evidence of Original Problems:
- `evidence/current/Evidence_BASELINE_PERFORMANCE.md` - Documents actual issues
- Original logs in `logs/searches/searches_2025-08-08.jsonl` - Shows real failures

## FOCUS AREAS (What we should actually work on):

### 1. TEST THE PRIMARY SYSTEM:
- `graph_aware_llm_coordinator.py` - This is what actually runs
- Does it solve the original problems from CLAUDE.md?
- Can it handle "find me different takes on the current trump epstein drama"?
- Does it avoid "find different 2024" repetition loops?

### 2. ORIGINAL FAILING SCENARIO:
From logs: Investigation stuck in primitive loops:
- Query: "find me different takes on the current trump epstein drama"
- Problem: Repeated "find different 2024" searches 40+ times
- Only used search.php endpoint
- 0.0 satisfaction after 100 searches

### 3. VERIFY GRAPHAWARE FIXES ISSUES:
- Endpoint diversity ✓ (appears working)
- Strategic reasoning ✓ (appears working) 
- BUT: Did it fix the SPECIFIC "find different" repetition problem?
- Does it properly score relevance instead of quantity?

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. **Archive my fallback system** (violates "no fallbacks" rule)
2. **Keep bug fixes** that improve primary system
3. **Test GraphAware against original failing scenarios**
4. **Focus on PRIMARY system improvements** only
5. **Verify the system actually solves documented problems**
