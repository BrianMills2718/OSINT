# Current System Issues - Dec 2, 2024

## System Status
- ✅ **API Working**: Successfully retrieves Twitter data (109-156 results)
- ✅ **LLM Strategy**: Generates intelligent search plans
- ✅ **Logger Fixed**: No more crashes
- ❌ **Finding Evaluator**: Produces 0 findings from raw data
- ❌ **Satisfaction**: Always 0.00
- ❌ **Query Tracking**: Loses track of search parameters

## The Core Problem

**The system retrieves tweets but doesn't analyze them.**

```
Input: "OpenAI GPT latest"
  ↓
Strategy: ✅ Smart plan generated
  ↓  
API Calls: ✅ 109 tweets retrieved
  ↓
Finding Creation: ❌ 0 findings produced
  ↓
Result: Useless investigation with no insights
```

## Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Finding Evaluator (Recommended)
1. Debug why tweets → findings conversion fails
2. Fix the LLMFindingEvaluator 
3. Ensure findings get created from tweets
4. Test satisfaction improves

### Option B: Simplify Architecture  
1. Remove complex graph/finding system
2. Just summarize tweets directly
3. Simpler but less sophisticated

### Option C: Start Fresh
1. Archive everything
2. Build minimal working version
3. Add complexity gradually

## Technical Details

The problem is likely in:
- `twitterexplorer/finding_evaluator_llm.py`
- The connection between raw results and finding creation
- The investigation engine's result processing flow

The Finding Evaluator either:
1. Isn't being called at all
2. Is being called with wrong parameters
3. Has a bug preventing finding creation
