# TwitterExplorer System Roadmap

## Current Status Assessment

### System Health Overview
- **Technical Functionality**: ✅ Operational (CLI executes, API calls work, graphs generate)
- **Investigation Quality**: ⚠️ Degraded (satisfaction scores 0.0-0.47 acceptable baseline, missing insight metadata)
- **Architecture Integrity**: ✅ Stable (bridge pattern, graph state, provider switching functional)
- **Model Configuration**: ✅ Confirmed using gpt-5-mini (latest OpenAI model)

### Issue Status (4 Total) - **Evidence Located**
- **Fixed**: 1/4 (Model Provider CLI Parameter) 
- **Broken with Evidence**: 3/4 (All documented in temp1.txt and evidence/ directory)
  - **Issue #1**: Streamlit Import Contamination (cosmetic warnings)
  - **Issue #2**: Untitled Insight Generation (gpt-5-mini structured output needs verification)
  - **Issue #3**: Placeholder API Parameters (lines 285,293: `REPLACE_WITH_TWEET_ID_FROM_TIMELINE`)

### **Uncertainties RESOLVED**
- ✅ **Original Evidence**: Located temp1.txt with exact CLAUDE.md references (lines 285,293)
- ✅ **Model Configuration**: Already using gpt-5-mini across all operations
- ✅ **Issue Scope**: Pre-existing problems documented in evidence/ directory
- ✅ **Satisfaction Scores**: Current 0.0-0.47 range acceptable as baseline

## Phase 1: Core CLI Functionality Restoration (Immediate - Week 1)

### 1.1 Core Value Delivery - Fix Insight Generation Pipeline
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - System produces insights with "No Title" and "No Confidence"
- **Business Impact**: Zero user value until fixed
- **Architecture Challenge**: Prompts and schemas scattered across 5 files making debugging difficult
- **Investigation Required**:
  - **Insight Pipeline Audit**: Map complete flow from prompt → LLM → schema → node → graph
  - **LLM Response Logging**: Capture raw responses to validate structure parsing
  - **Property Persistence Testing**: Verify kwargs flow through Node constructors
  - **JSON Serialization Validation**: Ensure properties survive graph export
- **Key Components to Examine**:
  - `realtime_insight_synthesizer.py:358` - Enhanced prompt (1331 chars)
  - `realtime_insight_synthesizer.py:41` - InsightSynthesis schema with title/confidence
  - `investigation_graph.py:149` - InsightNode constructor and property handling
  - `_create_insight_node()` method - Property passing mechanism
- **Solution Strategy**:
  - Create consolidated debugging view of insight-related prompts/schemas
  - Implement response validation middleware with detailed error logging
  - Add property persistence verification at each pipeline stage
  - Design fallback title generation system for edge cases

### 1.2 CLI Quality Baseline Establishment
- **Objective**: Define what "working correctly" means with measurable criteria
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Investigation satisfaction scores (target: >0.7)
  - Insight completeness rate (target: 100% have titles/confidence)
  - Search result relevance (target: >80% relevant to query)
  - System completion rate (target: >95% investigations complete)
- **Evidence Collection**:
  - Create repeatable test scenarios with expected outcomes
  - Document current system behavior with concrete examples
  - Establish before/after comparison framework

### 1.3 Investigation Pipeline Health Assessment  
- **Objective**: Understand the complete data flow from query to insights
- **Scattered Architecture Impact**: Must trace across multiple files to understand LLM interactions
- **Analysis Required**:
  - **LLM Interaction Mapping**: Document all 10 prompts and 23 schemas across 5 files
  - **API Response Quality**: Assess relevance and content quality of Twitter API responses
  - **DataPoint Creation**: Validate content extraction and relevance scoring
  - **Insight Synthesis Triggers**: Analyze conditions and success rates for insight generation
  - **Graph State Integrity**: Verify node relationships and property persistence
- **Deliverables**:
  - Complete pipeline flow diagram showing scattered component interactions
  - Consolidated view of insight-related prompts and schemas for debugging
  - Failure point identification with file/line references
  - Performance bottleneck analysis across distributed architecture

## Phase 2: CLI Reliability & Polish (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Architecture Consolidation & Secondary Issues
- **Prompt/Schema Consolidation** - Address scattered architecture identified in audit
  - **Current State**: 23 schemas across 5 files, 10 prompts across 5 files
  - **Target**: Centralized `prompts/` and `schemas/` modules for maintainability
  - **Benefits**: Easier debugging, version control, consistency, A/B testing capability
- **Issue #3: Placeholder API Parameters** - Complete investigation and resolution
  - Locate original evidence or establish current status definitively
  - Implement comprehensive parameter validation if needed
- **Issue #1: Streamlit Import Contamination** - Cosmetic cleanup
  - Map complete import tree across all modules (lower priority)
  - Implement CLI-specific entry point isolation
  - Note: Polish work after core functionality restored

### 2.2 Investigation Quality Optimization
- **Objective**: Achieve consistent >0.7 satisfaction scores
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Search strategy effectiveness (query formulation, endpoint selection)
  - DataPoint relevance filtering and ranking
