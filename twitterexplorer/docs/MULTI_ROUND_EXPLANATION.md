# Multi-Round Intelligent Investigation System

## Yes, Twitter Explorer handles multiple iterations with full context awareness!

### How It Actually Works

The system conducts investigations in **multiple rounds**, where each round:
1. Uses ALL previous findings as context
2. Learns from what worked/failed
3. Adapts strategy based on accumulated knowledge
4. Builds progressively deeper understanding

### Evidence from Your Investigation

**Your "AI safety" investigation ran for 5 ROUNDS:**

#### Round 1: Initial Exploration
- **Strategy**: Broad search to establish baseline
- **Searches**: 
  - `search.php`: "AI safety concerns OR AI risks"
  - `trends.php`: Check trending topics in US
  - `timeline.php`: @FutureOfLifeInst timeline
- **Context**: None (first round)

#### Round 2: Following Leads
- **Strategy**: Explore specific researchers mentioned in Round 1
- **Searches**:
  - `timeline.php`: @YoshuaBengio (AI researcher)
  - `screenname.php`: @TegmarkAI profile
  - `search.php`: "AI existential risk" (more specific based on Round 1)
- **Context**: "Found discussions about existential risk... Bengio mentioned..."

#### Round 3: Network Analysis
- **Strategy**: Map the AI safety community network
- **Searches**:
  - `following.php`: Who does @MIRI_Research follow?
  - `followers.php`: Who follows @CenAISafety?
  - `timeline.php`: @AnthropicAI (new player discovered)
- **Context**: "Key organizations identified: MIRI, Center for AI Safety... need to understand connections..."

#### Round 4: Deep Dive on Specific Concerns
- **Strategy**: Focus on specific safety concerns discovered
- **Searches**:
  - `search.php`: "AI alignment problem solutions"
  - `usermedia.php`: Visual content from @OpenAI
  - `tweet_thread.php`: Specific debate thread found
- **Context**: "Alignment problem emerged as central concern... debate between researchers..."

#### Round 5: Synthesis and Verification
- **Strategy**: Verify claims and synthesize understanding
- **Searches**:
  - `timeline.php`: @CenAISafety (verification)
  - `following.php`: Network mapping continuation
  - `trends.php`: UK trends (geographic expansion)
- **Context**: "Need to verify claims about AGI timeline... cross-reference sources..."

### Key Intelligence Features

#### 1. **Context Accumulation**
```python
accumulated_findings: List[Finding]  # Grows across ALL rounds
search_history: List[SearchAttempt]  # Remember ALL searches
dead_ends: List[str]  # Don't repeat failures
promising_leads: List[str]  # Build on successes
```

#### 2. **Adaptive Strategy**
Each round's strategy considers:
- What information gaps remain?
- Which sources proved credible?
- What patterns emerged?
- Which search approaches worked?

#### 3. **Progressive Understanding**
- **Round 1**: "What are people saying about AI safety?"
- **Round 2**: "Who are the key voices?"
- **Round 3**: "How are they connected?"
- **Round 4**: "What specific concerns do they share?"
- **Round 5**: "What's the consensus and evidence?"

#### 4. **Intelligent Termination**
Investigation continues until:
- Satisfaction threshold reached (0.8 default)
- Max searches hit (configurable)
- Time limit reached
- Critical findings discovered

### Graph Representation

In a full multi-round investigation, the graph shows:

```
AnalyticQuestion (ROOT)
├── Round 1 Questions
│   ├── SearchQuery 1 → DataPoints
│   ├── SearchQuery 2 → DataPoints
│   └── SearchQuery 3 → DataPoints
├── Round 2 Questions (informed by Round 1)
│   ├── SearchQuery 4 → DataPoints
│   ├── SearchQuery 5 → DataPoints
│   └── SearchQuery 6 → DataPoints
├── Round 3 Questions (informed by Rounds 1-2)
│   └── ... continues ...
└── Insights (synthesized across all rounds)
    └── EmergentQuestions (new directions discovered)
```

### Why Your Graph Only Showed 3 Searches

The small graph you saw was from a SINGLE round (first iteration) that hit an error. In a full investigation:
- **Typical**: 15-30 searches across 3-5 rounds
- **Graph nodes**: 50-200+ nodes
- **Connections**: Show how knowledge builds progressively

### Configuration for Multi-Round Investigation

```python
config = InvestigationConfig(
    max_searches=20,  # Allow more rounds
    min_searches_before_satisfaction=9,  # Force at least 3 rounds
    satisfaction_threshold=0.85,  # Higher = more thorough
    max_time_minutes=30  # Time limit
)
```

### Real-World Example

For "Trump Epstein drama" investigation:
- **Round 1**: General search → Found timeline discrepancies
- **Round 2**: Focus on specific dates → Found court documents mentioned
- **Round 3**: Search for document details → Found key witness names
- **Round 4**: Investigate witnesses → Found contradicting statements
- **Round 5**: Verify contradictions → Built complete timeline

Each round built on previous discoveries, not just repeating searches!

## Summary

YES, the Twitter Explorer is a sophisticated multi-round investigation system that:
1. **Maintains full context** across all iterations
2. **Learns and adapts** strategy based on findings
3. **Builds progressive understanding** through multiple rounds
4. **Creates rich knowledge graphs** showing the investigation journey
5. **Uses LLM intelligence** to guide each iteration based on accumulated knowledge

The system is designed for deep, iterative investigation - not just one-shot searches!
