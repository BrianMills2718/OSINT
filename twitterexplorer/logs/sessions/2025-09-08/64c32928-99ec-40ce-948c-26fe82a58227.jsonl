The highest-priority gap is mapping the range of perspectives (activists, scientists, industry, conservative and progressive politicians, journalists, and general public) and the specific policy flashpoints (carbon tax, cap-and-trade, Green New Deal, net-zero, adaptation, climate finance). The next coherent step is to collect representative tweets and timelines from key actors, surface trending climate-policy topics by region, and map at least one influencer's network to see recurring sources and allied organizations. This will produce a foundation for systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis in later rounds. To satisfy the requirement for diverse endpoints and complementary searches, the plan combines broad topical search, trending-topic discovery, targeted timelines for different stakeholder types, and a small network query.", "searches_executed": 1, "total_results": 121, "round_effectiveness": 5.0, "key_insights": ["There is a widespread and ongoing debate regarding climate change policies, particularly focusing on environmental regulations and their economic implications.", "Multiple sources (at least 20 identified discussions) explicitly aim to present 'various perspectives' on these policy aspects.", "The core of the policy debate appears to involve the interplay and potential trade-offs between environmental protection measures and their economic impacts."], "next_strategy_hints": []}
