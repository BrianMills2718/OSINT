To fill these gaps efficiently and coherently, the next round should combine broad topical search queries, trend monitoring, timelines of representative accounts (activist, technocrat, business/philanthropy), and simple network endpoints to reveal affiliations/followers. Using multiple endpoints (search.php, trends.php, timeline.php, followers.php, affilates.php) satisfies the diversity requirement and produces complementary data: topical breadth (search), real-time salience (trends), direct voice samples (timelines), and network context (followers/affiliates).", "searches_executed": 1, "total_results": 121, "round_effectiveness": 0.0, "key_insights": [], "next_strategy_hints": []}
