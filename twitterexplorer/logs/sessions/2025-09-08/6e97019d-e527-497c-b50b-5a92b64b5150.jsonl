The next round should fill that core gap by collecting (a) representative tweets across time (Top + Latest) to identify dominant frames and emerging narratives, (b) official and activist timelines to capture institutional vs. grassroots policy perspectives, and (c) audience/follower signals and trending topics to understand salience and partisan or regional patterns. To meet the investigation constraints, I will use multiple endpoint types (search, timeline, trends, followers, affilates) so results are complementary and enable mapping of perspectives, influence, and networks.", "searches_executed": 1, "total_results": 121, "round_effectiveness": 0.0, "key_insights": [], "next_strategy_hints": []}
