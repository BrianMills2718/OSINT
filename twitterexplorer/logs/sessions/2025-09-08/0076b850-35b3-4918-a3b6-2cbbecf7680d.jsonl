The immediate priority is to (1) locate the origin(s) of the claim on Twitter, (2) check whether Trump or official US military/Defense accounts tweeted or announced anything about sending forces to Venezuela, and (3) capture how the claim is spreading and which accounts amplify it. The selected searches mix broad content discovery (to find claim variants and viral posts) with authoritative timeline checks (to confirm or refute official action) and a target profile check on the Venezuelan president to capture any reaction or claims from Venezuela. This addresses the most important information gaps first and uses diverse endpoints (search.php, timeline.php, screenname.php) as required.", "searches_executed": 3, "total_results": 153, "round_effectiveness": 5.1000000000000005, "key_insights": ["Found 115 relevant results"], "next_strategy_hints": []}
