This initial round focuses on broad discovery by identifying general debates, specific policy types, real-time national discussions, and the direct viewpoint of a key international organization. This multi-faceted approach ensures a comprehensive initial scan, covering various angles from global to specific policy mechanisms and their public discourse. Using diverse endpoints (search, trends, timeline) is crucial to avoid a narrow data collection strategy and to start identifying influential voices and active discussions.", "searches_executed": 3, "total_results": 67, "round_effectiveness": 4.2, "key_insights": ["There is a perspective that climate change is a major problem and current policies or lack thereof are distressing to climate scientists.", "A strong skeptical perspective argues that the scientific basis for climate policy is weak, suggesting warming precedes CO2 and science is unsettled.", "Denialism and short-term economic priorities are seen as hindering effective policy responses."], "next_strategy_hints": []}
