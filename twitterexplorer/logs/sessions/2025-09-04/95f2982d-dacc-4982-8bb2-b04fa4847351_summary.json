This combination fills the most important information gaps (current claims, official statements, and signal intensity) and creates multiple threads (news, social media, official account) that can be followed in subsequent rounds. The plan uses diverse endpoints (search.php, trends.php, timeline.php, screenname.php) as required and produces complementary outputs: broad signals from general search, authoritative verification from news-source-specific search, trend context, and primary-source posts/profile for verification and network mapping.",
