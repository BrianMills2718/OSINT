This strategy pivots to identifying key individuals and the type of content they share to overcome the relevance issue and fill critical information gaps. By first mapping the network around the official X account (`following.php`, `followers.php`), we aim to discover authoritative or influential secondary sources and relevant discussions. Simultaneously, searching for media posted by the official X account (`usermedia.php`) directly targets visual announcements of new features, which are often overlooked by text-based timeline searches and addresses the issue of irrelevant text-based content.
