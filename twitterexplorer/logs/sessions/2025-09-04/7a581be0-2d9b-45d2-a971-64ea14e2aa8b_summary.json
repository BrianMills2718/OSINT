The most coherent next action is a coordinated first-round data sweep using multiple complementary endpoints: broad topical searches to surface the latest claims and media, targeted pulls of primary accounts for official messaging, and a trends/network check to prioritize where to dig deeper. This uses diverse endpoints (search, timeline, screenname, followers, trends) so we don’t rely solely on search.php and we produce threads to connect into deeper conversation analysis next round.",
