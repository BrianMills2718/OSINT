The highest priority is to close basic knowledge gaps: current public reporting and chatter about Trump’s health, official/first-party statements, and the principal accounts and affiliations that amplify or verify health-related claims. A coordinated first round should (1) surface the latest public posts and media coverage, (2) check whether the topic is trending domestically, and (3) map the subject’s own recent posts and institutional/affiliate network so follow-ups can target authoritative tweets, official statements, and connected actors. To satisfy the mandatory diversity rule and create complementary leads, the next round will combine broad content search, national trends, the subject’s timeline, and affiliate mapping. These outputs will produce concrete tweet IDs, accounts, and themes for targeted conversation and network analysis in the next round.", "searches_executed": 3, "total_results": 165, "round_effectiveness": 5.5, "key_insights": ["Found 115 relevant results"], "next_strategy_hints": []}
