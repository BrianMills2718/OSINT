The highest priority is to establish a current, evidence-based baseline about 'Trump health' by (1) capturing the live public conversation, (2) retrieving authoritative news reporting, (3) checking whether the topic is trending in the United States, and (4) obtaining direct statements and profile context from Trump's account. This combination fills the most important information gaps (current claims, official statements, and signal intensity) and creates multiple threads (news, social media, official account) that can be followed in subsequent rounds. The plan uses diverse endpoints (search.php, trends.php, timeline.php, screenname.php) as required and produces complementary outputs: broad signals from general search, authoritative verification from news-source-specific search, trend context, and primary-source posts/profile for verification and network mapping.", "searches_executed": 3, "total_results": 153, "round_effectiveness": 5.1000000000000005, "key_insights": ["Found 60 relevant results"], "next_strategy_hints": []}
