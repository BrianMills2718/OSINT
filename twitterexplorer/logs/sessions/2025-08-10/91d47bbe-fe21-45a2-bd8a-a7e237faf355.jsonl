Since the investigation is in its nascent stage with no defined original goal, the most strategic next step is to establish a foundational framework for graph tracking. This involves identifying potential central entities (nodes) and their immediate relationships (edges) to test the efficacy of queries and data collection methods for building a social graph. By starting with a prominent public figure and exploring their network and content, we can effectively test the 'graph tracking' capabilities of the available endpoints.", "searches_executed": 2, "total_results": 0, "round_effectiveness": 0.0, "key_insights": [], "next_strategy_hints": []}
