Screenname.php will confirm the user's existence and basic profile information, acting as a diagnostic check for why previous calls might have failed to return data. Usermedia.php will provide access to any visual communications, which are often used by Elon Musk to convey messages.

This suggests a fundamental issue with accessing data for this specific user or a broader problem with the search/user lookup endpoints. The most strategically coherent next step is to diagnose the underlying cause of these 'no data' outcomes. By attempting searches for a known, highly active public figure (NASA) using the same endpoints that failed for Elon Musk, we can determine if the issue is user-specific or a general system malfunction. If the diagnostic searches for NASA succeed, it narrows the problem to Elon Musk's account or specific access parameters.
