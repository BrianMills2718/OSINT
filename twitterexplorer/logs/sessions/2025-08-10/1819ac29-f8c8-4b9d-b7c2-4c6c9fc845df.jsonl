Given the current lack of defined goals and collected data, this approach focuses on building a foundational understanding of node and edge extraction. We will target a prominent entity (Elon Musk) and a relevant topic ('AI') as starting points to demonstrate diverse query types across user, content, and network analysis endpoints. This will establish initial methods for identifying users (nodes), tweets (nodes), and their relationships (edges) such as followers, following, replies, and retweets, crucial for developing a comprehensive graph tracking methodology.", "searches_executed": 2, "total_results": 0, "round_effectiveness": 0.0, "key_insights": [], "next_strategy_hints": []}
