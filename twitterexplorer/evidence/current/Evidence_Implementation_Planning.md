# Evidence: Implementation Planning - LLM Call Optimization

**Generated**: 2025-09-11  
**Phase**: Technical Investigation - Implementation Strategy  
**Target**: ≤6 LLM calls per search, ≤$1.00 per investigation  

## Implementation Strategy Overview

Based on comprehensive technical analysis, **3-phase implementation approach** identified with **LOW RISK** and **HIGH REWARD** potential.

## Phase 1: Bridge Batching Logic (CRITICAL PATH)

### Target Impact
- **Current**: 6.5 LLM calls per search from quadratic growth
- **Optimized**: 1.0 LLM call per search with batching
- **Savings**: 5.5 calls per search (84% reduction)

### Implementation Details

#### Modification Location
**File**: `twitterexplorer/investigation_bridge.py`  
**Method**: `notify_insight_created` (lines 88-167)  
**Risk Level**: LOW (isolated method, no breaking changes)

#### Implementation Approach
```python
class ConcreteInvestigationBridge:
    def __init__(self, coordinator, graph, context):
        self.coordinator = coordinator
        self.graph = graph  
        self.context = context
        # NEW: Batching logic
        self.pending_insights = []
        self.batch_size = 3  # Process every 3 insights
        self.batch_timeout = 30  # Process after 30 seconds
        self.last_batch_time = time.time()
        
    def notify_insight_created(self, insight_node: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Batched insight processing to eliminate quadratic growth"""
        # Add to batch
        self.pending_insights.append(insight_node.get('id'))
        
        # Trigger batch processing if conditions met
        current_time = time.time()
        should_process = (
            len(self.pending_insights) >= self.batch_size or
            (self.pending_insights and current_time - self.last_batch_time > self.batch_timeout)
        )
        
        if should_process:
            return self._process_insight_batch()
        
        return []  # No immediate processing
    
    def _process_insight_batch(self):
        """Process accumulated insights in single LLM call"""
        if not self.pending_insights:
            return []
            
        # Get all insights for emergent question detection
        all_insights = self.graph.get_nodes_by_type("Insight")
        
        # SINGLE LLM call for entire batch
        emergent_questions = self.coordinator.detect_emergent_questions(all_insights)
        
        # Reset batch
        self.pending_insights.clear()
        self.last_batch_time = time.time()
        
        return emergent_questions
```

#### Testing Strategy
```python
def test_batching_eliminates_quadratic_growth():
    """Verify batching reduces call count from O(n²) to O(1)"""
    bridge = ConcreteInvestigationBridge(mock_coordinator, mock_graph, mock_context)
    bridge.batch_size = 3
    
    # Simulate 9 insights (should create 3 batches)
    for i in range(9):
        bridge.notify_insight_created({'id': f'insight_{i}'})
    
    # Verify: 3 LLM calls instead of 45 (quadratic)
    assert llm_call_count == 3
    assert optimization_achieved == 93%  # (45-3)/45
```

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: `USE_BATCHED_BRIDGE = True/False`
- A/B testing with 10% traffic initially
- Automatic fallback on errors
- Quality metrics monitoring

## Phase 2: Cross-Reference Removal (QUICK WIN)

### Target Impact
- **Current**: 1.0 LLM call per search
- **Optimized**: 0.0 LLM calls per search  
- **Savings**: 1.0 call per search (100% reduction)

### Implementation Details

#### Modification Location
**File**: `twitterexplorer/investigation_engine.py`  
**Lines**: Remove cross-reference analyzer instantiation and calls  
**Risk Level**: MINIMAL (optional component)

#### Implementation Approach
```python
# BEFORE (current)
if hasattr(self, 'cross_reference_analyzer'):
    cross_ref_analysis = self.cross_reference_analyzer.analyze(findings, investigation_goal)
    
# AFTER (optimized)  
# REMOVED: Cross-reference analysis provides minimal value for high cost
cross_ref_analysis = None  # Placeholder for backwards compatibility
```

#### Quality Impact Assessment
- **Investigation quality**: No significant degradation expected
- **Contradiction detection**: Alternative rule-based approach available
- **User experience**: No visible change

### Testing Strategy
```python
def test_cross_reference_removal_maintains_quality():
    """Verify investigation quality preserved without cross-reference"""
    # Run identical investigations with/without cross-reference
    results_with = run_investigation(query, use_cross_reference=True)
    results_without = run_investigation(query, use_cross_reference=False)
    
    # Quality should be ≥95% preserved
    assert quality_score(results_without) >= 0.95 * quality_score(results_with)
```

## Phase 3: Synthesizer Optimization (INCREMENTAL)

### Target Impact
- **Current**: 3.0 LLM calls per search (synthesis_decision, semantic_grouping, insight_synthesis)
- **Optimized**: 2.0 LLM calls per search (combined decision+grouping, insight_synthesis)
- **Savings**: 1.0 call per search (33% reduction)

### Implementation Details

#### Modification Location  
**File**: `twitterexplorer/realtime_insight_synthesizer.py`  
**Methods**: Combine `_should_synthesize_llm` and `_group_semantically_llm`  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (core synthesis logic)

#### Implementation Approach
```python
def _analyze_and_group_datapoints(self, datapoints: List[Node]) -> CombinedAnalysis:
    """Combined analysis: synthesis decision + semantic grouping in single LLM call"""
    
    prompt = f"""
    INVESTIGATION: {self.context.analytic_question}
    DATAPOINTS: {[dp.properties for dp in datapoints]}
    
    TASK: Analyze datapoints for both synthesis worthiness AND semantic grouping.
    
    Return:
    1. synthesis_decision: should_synthesize (bool), rationale (str)
    2. semantic_groups: if should_synthesize, group datapoints by theme
    """
    
    response = self.llm.completion(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        response_format=CombinedAnalysis,  # New combined schema
        purpose="combined_synthesis_analysis"
    )
```

#### Quality Preservation Strategy
- Parallel execution: Run old + new methods initially
- Quality comparison: Ensure combined approach maintains accuracy
- Gradual rollout: 25% → 50% → 100% traffic

### Testing Strategy
```python
def test_synthesizer_combining_preserves_quality():
    """Verify combined synthesis maintains insight quality"""
    # Compare separate vs combined approaches
    insights_separate = run_separate_synthesis(datapoints)
    insights_combined = run_combined_synthesis(datapoints)
    
    # Quality metrics should be equivalent
    assert insight_quality(insights_combined) >= 0.95 * insight_quality(insights_separate)
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Phase 1 Implementation
- **Day 1-2**: Bridge batching logic implementation
- **Day 3-4**: Unit testing and integration testing
- **Day 5**: A/B testing setup and initial rollout

### Week 2: Phase 2 & Quality Validation  
- **Day 1**: Cross-reference removal implementation
- **Day 2-3**: Quality impact assessment
- **Day 4-5**: Performance validation and monitoring

### Week 3: Phase 3 (Optional Enhancement)
- **Day 1-3**: Synthesizer optimization implementation
- **Day 4-5**: Quality comparison and gradual rollout

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
1. **Batching introduces latency**
   - Mitigation: Tunable batch size and timeout
   - Fallback: Individual processing on timeout

2. **Combined synthesis reduces quality**  
   - Mitigation: Parallel execution during rollout
   - Fallback: Revert to separate calls if quality drops

3. **Integration issues**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage
   - Fallback: Feature flags for instant rollback

### Quality Assurance Plan
```python
# Continuous quality monitoring
def monitor_optimization_quality():
    """Monitor key quality metrics during optimization rollout"""
    metrics = {
        'insight_relevance': measure_insight_relevance(),
        'emergent_question_quality': measure_question_quality(),
        'investigation_completeness': measure_completeness(),
        'user_satisfaction': measure_satisfaction()
    }
    
    # Alert if any metric drops >5%
    for metric, value in metrics.items():
        if value < baseline[metric] * 0.95:
            trigger_rollback(f"Quality degradation in {metric}")
```

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Primary Success Criteria (MUST ACHIEVE)

- ✅ ≤$1.00 per investigation (target: $0.26, current: $2.83)  
- ✅ Quality preservation ≥95% across all metrics

### Performance Validation Tests
```python

    """Comprehensive validation of optimization goals"""
    
    # Run 10 test investigations  
    results = []
    for i in range(10):
        result = run_investigation(test_queries[i])
        results.append({
            'llm_calls': result.total_llm_calls,
            'cost': result.total_cost, 
            'quality_score': result.quality_metrics.overall_score()
        })
    
    # Validate against targets
    avg_calls = sum(r['llm_calls'] for r in results) / len(results)
    avg_cost = sum(r['cost'] for r in results) / len(results)
    avg_quality = sum(r['quality_score'] for r in results) / len(results)
    
    assert avg_calls <= 6.0, f"LLM calls target missed: {avg_calls}"
    assert avg_cost <= 1.00, f"Cost target missed: ${avg_cost}"
