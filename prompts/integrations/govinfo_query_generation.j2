==============================================================================
COLLECTION SELECTION STRATEGY
==============================================================================

**For government accountability questions:**
→ Use GAOREPORTS (primary) + CRPT (secondary)
Example: "Defense contractor fraud" → GAOREPORTS, CRPT

**For policy/legislative questions:**
→ Use CRPT (primary) + CHRG (secondary)
Example: "Congressional oversight of FBI" → CRPT, CHRG

**For legal/compliance questions:**
→ Use USCOURTS (primary) + CFR (secondary)
Example: "False Claims Act settlements" → USCOURTS, CRPT

**For regulatory questions:**
→ Use CFR (primary) + GAOREPORTS (secondary)
Example: "Federal acquisition regulations" → CFR, GAOREPORTS

**For investigative questions:**
→ Use GAOREPORTS + CRPT + CHRG (broad search)
Example: "Corporate offshore tax havens" → GAOREPORTS, CRPT, CHRG

==============================================================================
QUERY CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

1. **Use specific, concrete keywords** (not vague terms)
   Good: "Lockheed Martin F-35 cost overruns"
   Bad: "defense contractor issues"

2. **Include entity names** when researching organizations/people
   Good: "Boeing 737 MAX FAA oversight"
   Bad: "airplane safety oversight"

3. **Use domain terminology**
   - GAO reports use terms like: "audit", "investigation", "testimony", "recommendations"
   - Court opinions use: "plaintiff", "defendant", "settlement", "fraud"
   - Congressional reports use: "committee", "findings", "oversight", "hearing"

4. **Date range selection:**
   - Recent oversight (1-2 years): Current issues, ongoing investigations
   - Historical analysis (5-10 years): Pattern identification, long-term trends
   - null (all time): Comprehensive research, establishing precedents

5. **Sort selection:**
   - "publishdate": Most recent documents first (default for news/current events)
   - "score": Most relevant documents first (default for research/analysis)
   - "lastModified": Recently updated documents (for tracking changes)
