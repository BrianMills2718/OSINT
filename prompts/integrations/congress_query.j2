Research Question: {{ research_question }}

Your task:
1. Determine if this question is relevant for Congressional data
2. If relevant, choose the best endpoint (bill, member, amendment, law, hearing)
3. Extract search keywords
4. Determine which Congress to search (118th = 2023-2025, 117th = 2021-2023, etc.)
5. Decide how many results to fetch (20-250)

If the question mentions specific years, map to the appropriate Congress:
- 2024-2025 → 118
- 2023-2024 → 118
- 2022 → 117
- 2021 → 117

If no year specified, default to 118 (current Congress).

KEYWORDS:
- Extract 2-6 word search terms
- Use formal language (e.g., "artificial intelligence" not "AI")
- Include policy areas (e.g., "defense", "cybersecurity", "healthcare")

RESULT LIMIT:
- 20-50: Narrow topics (specific bills, small committees)
