RESEARCH QUESTION:
{{ research_question }}

SEC EDGAR CHARACTERISTICS:
Strengths:
- Corporate filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports, 8-K current reports)
- Financial statements and data (revenue, assets, liabilities via XBRL)
- Insider trading reports (Form 3, 4, 5)
- Proxy statements (executive compensation, board composition)
- Merger and acquisition filings
- IPO documents (S-1 registration statements)
- Company ownership and structure
- Historical filings back to 1994

Limitations:
- Only covers publicly-traded companies and entities required to file with SEC
- Does not include private companies (unless recently went public)
- No government contract details (use SAM.gov for that)
- No job postings (use USAJobs/ClearanceJobs for that)
- Financial data only (not operational/product details unless disclosed)

DECISION CRITERIA:
- Is relevant: If seeking corporate financial data, SEC filings, insider trading, or public company information
- NOT relevant: If ONLY seeking operational details, private companies, government contracts, or employment data
