Is SEC EDGAR relevant for researching this question?

RESEARCH QUESTION:
{{ research_question }}

SEC EDGAR CHARACTERISTICS:
Strengths:
- Corporate filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports, 8-K current reports)
- Financial statements and data (revenue, assets, liabilities via XBRL)
- Insider trading reports (Form 3, 4, 5)
- Proxy statements (executive compensation, board composition)
- Merger and acquisition filings
- IPO documents (S-1 registration statements)
- Company ownership and structure
- SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS and compliance issues disclosed in filings
- Historical filings back to 1994

Limitations:
- Only covers publicly-traded companies and entities required to file with SEC
- Does not include private companies (unless recently went public)
- No government contract details (use SAM.gov/USAspending for that)
- No job postings (use USAJobs/ClearanceJobs for that)

CRITICAL - PARTIAL RELEVANCE RULE:
If a research question mentions MULTIPLE topics and ANY ONE of them relates to SEC filings, corporate financial data, SEC enforcement, insider trading, or public company information, return relevant=true. Do NOT reject just because the question also asks about topics SEC EDGAR doesn't cover (like government contracts).

Example: "contractors who received funding AND face SEC enforcement" → relevant=TRUE (SEC EDGAR handles the "SEC enforcement" part; other sources handle the contracts part)

DECISION CRITERIA:
- Is relevant: If seeking corporate financial data, SEC filings, SEC enforcement actions, insider trading, public company information, or compliance disclosures
- Is relevant: If the question mentions "SEC" in any context (enforcement, filings, investigations)
- NOT relevant ONLY if: The question has ZERO corporate/SEC/financial component
