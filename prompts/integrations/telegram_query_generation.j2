## Available Query Patterns

You can use ANY of these query patterns depending on what the research question needs:

1. **channel_search**

   - When to use: Finding relevant Telegram channels
   - Required: query (channel name or topic)
   - Example: "OSINT channels" or "Bellingcat"

2. **channel_messages**
   - Purpose: Get recent messages from a specific channel
   - When to use: Monitoring a known channel (e.g., @bellingcat, @CITeam_en, @OpenSourceIntel)
   - Required: channel_username (without @ symbol)
   - Example: "bellingcat", "CITeam_en"

3. **global_search**
   - Purpose: Search for messages across channels by keywords
   - When to use: Finding discussions on a topic across multiple channels
   - Required: keywords (array of search terms)
   - Example: ["Ukraine", "HIMARS"] or ["contract", "Anduril"]

4. **channel_info**

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the research question** to determine what type of information is needed
2. **Select the most appropriate query pattern** from the list above
3. **Generate the required parameters** for that pattern
4. **Explain your reasoning** for choosing this pattern and these parameters

**Decision Tree**:
- Does the question ask about **a specific channel** (e.g., "@bellingcat")? → Use channel_messages or channel_info
- Does it ask to **find channels** on a topic? → Use channel_search
- Does it ask about **discussions or messages** on a topic (no specific channel)? → Use global_search
- Does it ask for **channel details or verification**? → Use channel_info

**Important Notes**:
- Telegram channels use @ symbol in URLs but not in API calls (e.g., @bellingcat → "bellingcat")
- Popular OSINT channels: bellingcat, CITeam_en, OpenSourceIntel, OSINT_Defender
- Official government channels often have verified badges
- Limit parameter: 10-100 (default 50)
