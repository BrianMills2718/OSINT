Generate search parameters for Reddit.

Reddit provides: Community discussions, news sharing, expert commentary, and public discourse
organized into topic-specific communities (subreddits).

API Parameters:
- query (string, required):
    Reddit search query syntax (empirically tested 2025-10-25):

    BEST SYNTAX (43% accuracy):
    - Use UNQUOTED keywords with AND: threat intelligence AND contract

    WORKING (15% accuracy):
    - Simple keywords: threat intelligence contract
    - Simple OR: JTTF OR counterterrorism

    AVOID (0% accuracy - breaks queries):
    - Quoted phrases with Boolean: "threat intelligence" AND contract
    - Parentheses for grouping: (contract OR procurement)
    - Nested queries: "threat intelligence" AND (contract OR procurement)

    Strategy: Use 2-3 unquoted keywords with AND for best results.
    Reddit's search uses fuzzy matching - even best syntax only achieves ~40% accuracy.

Research Question: {{ research_question }}

Reddit is useful for:

- Community discussions on intelligence, security, geopolitics
- Expert commentary from intelligence community members (often anonymous)
- News discussions and reactions to events
- OSINT research and techniques
- Investigative journalism discussions
- Whistleblower revelations and leaks
