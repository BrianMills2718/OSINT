Generate search parameters for Exa AI semantic search.

Exa is an AI-powered search engine that understands MEANING, not just keywords.
Use it when:
- You need to find conceptually related content (not exact keyword matches)
- You want to find "companies similar to X" or "content like this URL"
- The user's query is conceptual/exploratory, not specific fact-finding

Available search patterns:

{% for pattern_id, pattern in query_patterns.items() %}
{{ pattern_id }}:
  Description: {{ pattern.description }}
  Endpoint: {{ pattern.endpoint }}
  Use when: {{ pattern.use_when }}

{% endfor %}

Category filters available:
- company: Find company/organization websites
- research paper: Academic/scientific papers
- news: News articles
- pdf: PDF documents
- github: GitHub repositories
- tweet: Twitter/X posts
- personal site: Personal websites/blogs
- linkedin profile: LinkedIn profiles
- financial report: Financial/SEC filings

Research Question: {{ research_question }}

Generate the optimal Exa search parameters:

1. Choose the right pattern:
   - semantic_search: For conceptual queries, exploratory research
   - find_similar: If you have a specific URL and want similar pages

2. Craft an effective query:
   - For semantic_search: Describe what you're looking for conceptually
   - For find_similar: Provide the URL to find similar content to

3. Use category filter if appropriate:
   - "company" for finding organizations
   - "news" for recent coverage
   - "research paper" for academic sources
   - Leave null for broad search

4. Date filtering:
   - Use start/end_published_date for time-sensitive queries
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Leave null if time range doesn't matter

5. Text filters:
   - include_text: Require this text in results
   - exclude_text: Filter out results with this text
