You are analyzing a research question to determine if the Wayback Machine (Internet Archive) is relevant and, if so, what URLs and timestamps to check for historical snapshots.

RESEARCH QUESTION:
{{ research_question }}

WAYBACK MACHINE CHARACTERISTICS:
The Wayback Machine is Internet Archive's historical web page snapshot service.

Strengths:
- 736 billion web pages archived since 1996
- Historical snapshots showing what websites looked like in the past
- Recover deleted or changed content
- Track how websites, messaging, or positions evolved over time
- Accountability research (prove what was said/published)
- Point-in-time evidence for investigations

Ideal Use Cases:
- "What did [company/org website] say about X in [year]?"
- "Show me the deleted content from [website]"
- "How has [organization]'s stance on X changed over time?"
- "What was on [website] before they updated it?"
- "Historical versions of privacy policies, terms of service, about pages"
- Tracking website changes for accountability journalism

Limitations:
- Web pages ONLY (not government documents, filings, databases, or APIs)
- Snapshots may be incomplete (not all resources like images/CSS captured)
- Not all websites are archived (robots.txt can block archiving)
- Cannot archive new pages on demand (archiving happens independently)
- Point-in-time snapshots (not real-time monitoring)
- No keyword search within archived pages (must know URL)

What Wayback Machine DOES NOT Have:
- Government filings or contracts (use SAM.gov, SEC EDGAR)
- News articles (use NewsAPI, Brave Search)
- Social media posts (use Twitter, Reddit integrations)
- Job postings (use USAJobs, ClearanceJobs)
- Database records or structured data

DECISION CRITERIA:

Is Relevant:
- Seeking historical website content or deleted pages
- Tracking changes to websites over time
- Accountability research (what was claimed/published)
- Recovery of removed content
- Timeline of website evolution

NOT Relevant:
- Only seeking current/live data
- Only seeking government filings, news, or structured data
- No specific website/domain in question
- Seeking content within archived pages (Wayback doesn't support keyword search)

TASK:
1. Determine if Wayback Machine is relevant for this question
2. If relevant, extract or infer the website URLs to check
3. Determine if a specific historical timestamp is needed (YYYYMMDD format)

URL EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:
- If question mentions specific domain/website → use that URL
- If question mentions company/org → infer their official website
- If question about specific pages → construct full URLs (e.g., example.com/about, example.com/privacy)
- Check multiple URLs if relevant (homepage, about page, specific sections)
- Limit to 10 URLs maximum (most important pages)

TIMESTAMP GUIDANCE:
- If question specifies date/year → convert to YYYYMMDD (e.g., "2020" → "20200101")
- If question says "before [event]" → estimate date before event
- If question says "current vs historical" → use null (get most recent snapshot)
- If no date mentioned → use null (get most recent available)

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Historical Content:
Question: "What did Boeing's website say about the 737 MAX safety in 2018?"
Response:
{
  "relevant": true,
  "reasoning": "Seeking historical website content from specific year - perfect use case for Wayback Machine",
  "urls": ["https://www.boeing.com", "https://www.boeing.com/commercial/737max", "https://www.boeing.com/safety"],
  "timestamp": "20180701",
  "description": "Checking Boeing website snapshots from mid-2018 for 737 MAX safety messaging"
}

Example 2 - Deleted Content:
Question: "What was on Cambridge Analytica's about page before they shut down?"
Response:
{
  "relevant": true,
  "reasoning": "Company shut down, seeking deleted content - Wayback Machine preserves historical snapshots",
  "urls": ["https://cambridgeanalytica.org", "https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about"],
  "timestamp": null,
  "description": "Retrieving archived snapshots of Cambridge Analytica website before shutdown"
}

Example 3 - Government Filings (NOT Relevant):
Question: "What government contracts does Lockheed Martin have?"
Response:
{
  "relevant": false,
  "reasoning": "Seeking government contract data (use SAM.gov), not historical website content",
  "urls": [],
  "timestamp": null,
  "description": ""
}

Example 4 - News Coverage (NOT Relevant):
Question: "What is the media saying about AI regulation?"
Response:
{
  "relevant": false,
  "reasoning": "Seeking news coverage (use NewsAPI), not historical website snapshots",
  "urls": [],
  "timestamp": null,
  "description": ""
}

Example 5 - Timeline Tracking:
Question: "How has SpaceX's Starship page evolved since 2019?"
Response:
{
  "relevant": true,
  "reasoning": "Tracking website evolution over time - comparing historical snapshots shows changes",
  "urls": ["https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship"],
  "timestamp": "20190101",
  "description": "Tracking SpaceX Starship page changes from 2019 to present"
}
