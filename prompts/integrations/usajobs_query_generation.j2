Generate search parameters for USAJobs.

USAJobs provides: Official U.S. federal government job listings across all agencies and departments.

API Parameters:
- keywords (string, required):
    Search query syntax (empirically tested 2025-10-25):

    BEST SYNTAX (most results):
    - Single keyword: intelligence
    - Two keywords (space): intelligence analyst

    WORKING (single Boolean operator only):
    - Simple AND: intelligence AND analyst
    - Simple OR: intelligence OR security
    - Simple NOT: intelligence NOT classified

    FORBIDDEN (returns 0 results):
    - Three or more keywords: intelligence analyst senior
    - Multiple OR terms: intelligence OR security OR analyst
    - Parentheses grouping: (intelligence OR security) AND analyst
    - Mixed syntax: "intelligence analyst" OR cybersecurity
    - Complex Boolean: Any query with 2+ Boolean operators

    STRATEGY:
    - PREFER: Single broad keyword (e.g., "cybersecurity" OR "analyst") for maximum results
    - ALLOW: Two keywords (space-separated) ONLY if single keyword is too broad (e.g., "intelligence analyst" when "analyst" alone would include non-intelligence roles)
    - ALLOW: Single Boolean operator if needed (AND/OR/NOT)
    - AVOID: Multi-word queries that are too restrictive (e.g., "cybersecurity analyst" returns only 1 result, while "cybersecurity" returns 44)
    - AVOID: Location filters unless explicitly requested (DC-area jobs include MD/VA)

    See docs/INTEGRATION_QUERY_GUIDES.md for detailed empirical test results.

    Geographic location (e.g., "Washington, DC", "California", "Remote")

    Reference: GS-1 to GS-4 = Entry level, GS-5 to GS-9 = Junior, GS-10 to GS-12 = Mid-level, GS-13 to GS-15 = Senior
