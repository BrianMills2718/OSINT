INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Determine if SEC EDGAR is relevant for this research question
2. If relevant, specify:
   - **query_type**: "company_filings" (get filings for specific company) or "company_search" (find company by name)
   - **company_name**: Full company name (e.g., "Apple Inc", "Lockheed Martin Corporation") - REQUIRED for searches
   - **form_types**: Array of SEC form types to filter (e.g., ["10-K", "10-Q"] for financial reports, ["4"] for insider trading, ["8-K"] for major events)
   - **keywords**: Keywords to search within filings (optional, for filtering results)
   - **limit**: Number of results (1-100, default 20)

3. **CRITICAL**: SEC EDGAR requires a specific company name. Generic keyword searches without a company are NOT supported.
   If the question doesn't mention a specific publicly-traded company, set relevant=false.

4. If NOT relevant (e.g., no specific company, private company, government contracts, job postings), set relevant=false

  "company_name": null,
  "form_types": [],
  "keywords": null,
  "limit": 20
}
```

**IMPORTANT FOR INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCH:**

When the research question mentions a SECTOR (like "defense contractors" or "AI companies") but no specific company:
1. If any specific company IS mentioned (even as an example like "Lockheed Martin"), use that company name
2. If you can infer a well-known public company from context (e.g., "Pentagon AI contractors" → Palantir is a major one), use that
3. If no public company can be identified, return relevant=false - SEC EDGAR cannot do topic-only searches

Common defense/tech companies that ARE public (have SEC filings):
- Lockheed Martin Corporation, Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Boeing, L3Harris
- Palantir Technologies, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon Web Services (part of Amazon), Google (Alphabet Inc)
- Leidos Holdings, CACI International, Booz Allen Hamilton, ManTech International
