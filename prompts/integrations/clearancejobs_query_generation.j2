Generate search parameters for ClearanceJobs.

ClearanceJobs provides: Security clearance job postings requiring TS/SCI, Secret, Top Secret, and other government clearances.

API Parameters:
- keywords (string, required):
    Search terms for job titles and descriptions.

    IMPORTANT Query Effectiveness Notes:
    - ClearanceJobs search works best with focused, specific queries
    - Very long queries (many comma-separated terms or excessive ORs) tend to return ALL jobs instead of filtering
    - Balance specificity vs breadth: use enough terms to capture the role, but not so many that the search breaks
    - Good approach: Core job title/role + 1-2 key qualifications OR synonyms
    - Example good queries:
      * "cybersecurity analyst" (simple, specific)
      * "SIGINT OR signals intelligence analyst" (synonyms for same concept)
      * "penetration tester OR ethical hacker" (common role synonyms)
    - Example overly broad queries that may fail:
      * "cyber, security, analyst, engineer, SIEM, Splunk, TS/SCI, ..." (too many terms)
      * Long lists of every possible synonym and tool

Research Question: {{ research_question }}

Generate a focused, effective search query that will actually filter results.
Consider: What is the core role or skill being searched? What are the 1-2 most important synonyms or qualifications?
