Generate search parameters for ClearanceJobs.

ClearanceJobs provides: Security clearance job postings requiring TS/SCI, Secret, Top Secret, and other government clearances.

API Parameters:
- keywords (string, required):
    Search terms for job titles and descriptions.

    CRITICAL: ClearanceJobs Limitation - NO Company Filtering
    - ClearanceJobs CANNOT filter by specific companies (e.g., "Northrop Grumman", "Lockheed Martin")
    - If the research question mentions company names, IGNORE them in the keywords
    - Focus ONLY on: job role/type + clearance level keywords
    - The LLM will filter for specific companies AFTER results are returned

    Example Query Transformation:
    - Question: "Northrop Grumman cybersecurity jobs requiring TS/SCI polygraph"
    - WRONG keywords: "Northrop Grumman cybersecurity TS/SCI polygraph" (too specific, returns nothing)
    - RIGHT keywords: "cybersecurity" (broad enough to return diverse results)

    IMPORTANT Query Effectiveness Notes:
    - ClearanceJobs search works best with focused, specific queries
    - Very long queries (many comma-separated terms or excessive ORs) tend to return ALL jobs instead of filtering
    - Balance specificity vs breadth: use enough terms to capture the role, but not so many that the search breaks
    - Good approach: Core job title/role + 1-2 key qualifications OR synonyms
    - DO NOT include: Company names, specific clearance levels (TS/SCI, Secret, etc.), location names
    - DO include: Job role/type, technical skills if critical to the role
    - Example good queries:
      * "cybersecurity analyst" (simple, specific)
      * "SIGINT OR signals intelligence analyst" (synonyms for same concept)
      * "penetration tester OR ethical hacker" (common role synonyms)
    - Example overly broad queries that may fail:
      * "cyber, security, analyst, engineer, SIEM, Splunk, TS/SCI, ..." (too many terms)
      * Long lists of every possible synonym and tool
    - Example queries to AVOID (too specific, include company/clearance):
      * "Northrop Grumman cybersecurity TS/SCI" (company name causes zero results)
      * "Secret clearance software engineer" (clearance level is extracted later, not searched)

Research Question: {{ research_question }}
