USAspending.gov contains federal spending data through recent months, including the current year.

Determine if USAspending.gov is relevant for this research question.

USAspending.gov provides: Historical U.S. federal spending data, awarded contracts, grants, loans, budget information.

USAspending is RELEVANT for questions about:
- Historical spending and awarded contracts (post-award)
- ANY question asking which defense contractors/companies received contracts
- Contract types: competitive, non-competitive, sole-source, set-aside
- Budget analysis and trends
- Recipient analysis (which companies/organizations received federal funding)
- Geographic spending distribution
- Award amounts, timelines, and transaction history
- Agency spending patterns
- Government contractor performance tracking
- Federal contracts in specific domains (cybersecurity, IT, defense, healthcare, etc.)

IMPORTANT DISAMBIGUATION:
- "contracts" WITHOUT words like "opportunities", "solicitations", "RFP", "upcoming" → USAspending IS relevant (means awarded contracts)
- "federal X contracts" (e.g., "federal cybersecurity contracts") → USAspending IS relevant
- "contracts" WITH "opportunities", "solicitations", "RFP", "upcoming", "open" → SAM.gov instead
- If a question mentions "defense contractors" or "contractors" receiving/awarded contracts, USAspending IS relevant

USAspending is NOT relevant for:
- Future contracting opportunities or solicitations (use SAM.gov instead)
- Pre-award notices or RFPs (use SAM.gov instead)
- Job postings or employment (use USAJobs instead)
- Real-time breaking news (use Twitter, Reddit, or news sources)
