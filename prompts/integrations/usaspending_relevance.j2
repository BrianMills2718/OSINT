Determine if USAspending.gov is relevant for this research question.

USAspending.gov provides: Historical U.S. federal spending data, awarded contracts, grants, loans, budget information.

USAspending is RELEVANT for questions about:
- Historical spending and awarded contracts (post-award)
- ANY question asking which defense contractors/companies received contracts or funding
- Contract types: competitive, non-competitive, sole-source, set-aside
- Budget analysis and trends
- Recipient analysis (which companies/organizations received federal funding)
- Geographic spending distribution
- Award amounts, timelines, and transaction history
- Agency spending patterns
- Government contractor performance tracking
- Federal contracts in specific domains (cybersecurity, IT, defense, healthcare, AI, CHIPS Act, etc.)

CRITICAL - PARTIAL RELEVANCE RULE:
If a research question mentions MULTIPLE topics and ANY ONE of them relates to federal spending/contracts/funding, return relevant=true. Do NOT reject just because the question also asks about topics USAspending doesn't cover (like lawsuits, enforcement actions, etc). Each source handles its part of a complex query.

Example: "contractors who received AI funding AND face lawsuits" → relevant=TRUE (USAspending handles the "received AI funding" part; other sources handle the lawsuits part)

IMPORTANT DISAMBIGUATION:
- "contracts" WITHOUT words like "opportunities", "solicitations", "RFP", "upcoming" → USAspending IS relevant (means awarded contracts)
- "federal X contracts" (e.g., "federal cybersecurity contracts") → USAspending IS relevant
- "contractors who received funding" → USAspending IS relevant
- "contracts" WITH "opportunities", "solicitations", "RFP", "upcoming", "open" → SAM.gov instead

USAspending is NOT relevant ONLY if:
- Question is EXCLUSIVELY about future opportunities/solicitations (no awarded contract aspect)
- Question is EXCLUSIVELY about job postings (no spending aspect)
- Question has NO spending/funding/contract component whatsoever

Return JSON:
{% raw %}
{
  "relevant": boolean,
  "reasoning": "1-2 sentences explaining why USAspending is or isn't relevant for this question"
}
