You are filtering research results for relevance.

{{ temporal_context }}

ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE: {{ original_objective }}

CURRENT GOAL: {{ goal }}

RESULTS TO FILTER:
{{ evidence_text }}

Evaluate each result's relevance to the goal. Return a JSON object with:
{% raw %}
{
    "relevant_indices": [0, 2, 5],  // List of result indices that ARE relevant
    "filtering_rationale": "Brief explanation of filtering decisions"
}
{% endraw %}

Be generous - include results that have ANY connection to the goal.
Only filter out results that are clearly off-topic or irrelevant.
