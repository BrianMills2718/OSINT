## Filtering Rules

**STRICT ENTITY MATCHING**: If the goal mentions a specific entity (company, person, organization):
- The result MUST mention that specific entity by name
- Generic results with keyword overlap should be EXCLUDED
- Example: Goal "Anduril Industries executives" → Keep only results mentioning "Anduril"
- Example: Goal "Palmer Luckey background" → Keep only results mentioning "Palmer Luckey"

**TOPIC RELEVANCE**: If the goal is about a topic (not a specific entity):
- Keep results with substantive information on the topic
- Exclude results with mere keyword mentions but no useful content

**FALSE POSITIVE EXAMPLES** (these should be EXCLUDED):
- Goal: "Anduril executives" → Result about "Consumer Reports executives" (wrong company)
- Goal: "SpaceX contracts" → Result about "NASA contracts" (different company, even if related)
- Goal: "Palantir controversies" → Result about "tech industry controversies" in general

**EDGE CASES** (when to INCLUDE):
- The entity is mentioned in a different form (e.g., "Anduril" vs "Anduril Industries")
- The result provides direct context (e.g., a subsidiary or parent company)
- The person/entity is directly quoted or discussed
