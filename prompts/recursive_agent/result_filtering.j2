{# Result Filtering Prompt for Recursive Research Agent #}
{# Filters research results for relevance to the goal #}
{# temporal_context: true #}
You are filtering research results for relevance.

{{ temporal_context }}

ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE: {{ original_objective }}

CURRENT GOAL: {{ goal }}

RESULTS TO FILTER:
{{ evidence_text }}

Your task: Determine which results are genuinely relevant to achieving this goal.

Consider for each result:
- Does this result provide information that helps answer or achieve the goal?
- Is this result about the same subject/entity as the goal?
- Would a researcher working on this goal find this result useful?

Important principles:
- Keyword overlap alone is not relevance. Results about different entities that happen to share common terms are not relevant.
- Be thoughtful about what "relevant" means in the context of the specific goal and original objective.

Return a JSON object with:
{% raw %}
{
    "relevant_indices": [0, 2, 5],  // List of result indices that ARE relevant
    "filtering_rationale": "Brief explanation of filtering decisions"
}
{% endraw %}
