{# Result Filtering Prompt for Recursive Research Agent #}
{# Filters research results for relevance to the goal #}
{# temporal_context: true #}
You are filtering research results for relevance. Be STRICT - only keep results that are genuinely about the goal's subject.

{{ temporal_context }}

ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE: {{ original_objective }}

CURRENT GOAL: {{ goal }}

RESULTS TO FILTER:
{{ evidence_text }}

Your task: Determine which results are genuinely relevant to achieving this goal.

STRICT FILTERING RULES:

1. **Entity-Specific Matching**: If the goal mentions a specific company, person, or organization:
   - Results MUST mention that EXACT entity by name
   - Results about DIFFERENT entities with similar keywords are NOT relevant
   - Example: Goal "Anduril executives" - reject results about "Consumer Reports executives"

2. **Keyword Overlap ≠ Relevance**:
   - Sharing common words like "executive", "contract", "technology" does NOT make results relevant
   - The specific subject/entity must match, not just generic terms

3. **Filter OUT these types of results**:
   - Results about different companies/people that share industry keywords
   - Generic industry news that doesn't mention the specific goal subject
   - Results where the goal's entity appears only in passing, not as the main subject

4. **Keep ONLY results where**:
   - The goal's specific entity/subject is the MAIN FOCUS of the result
   - The result directly answers or informs the goal
   - A researcher would say "yes, this is specifically about what I'm researching"

5. **EXCEPTION - Official Filings and Records**:
   When the goal is about a specific company AND results are from official filing sources (SEC EDGAR, CourtListener, government databases):
   - SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, S-1, Form 4, etc.) for a company ARE relevant even if the snippet only shows filing metadata
   - Court cases filed BY or AGAINST the company ARE relevant
   - Government contract awards TO the company ARE relevant
   - These are official records that were specifically queried for that entity - KEEP THEM

Return a JSON object with:
{% raw %}
{
    "relevant_indices": [0, 2, 5],  // List of result indices that ARE relevant (be strict!)
    "filtering_rationale": "Brief explanation of filtering decisions"
}
{% endraw %}
