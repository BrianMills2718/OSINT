GOAL: {{ goal }}

ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE: {{ original_objective }}

SUB-GOAL RESULTS:
{{ results_summary }}

TOTAL EVIDENCE GATHERED: {{ total_evidence }} pieces

Has this goal been SUFFICIENTLY achieved to stop pursuing more sub-goals?

CRITICAL - COMPARATIVE/ANALYTICAL GOALS:
If the GOAL or ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE contains:
- "compare", "vs", "versus", "contrast", "difference between"
- "analyze", "assess", "evaluate", "examine", "relationship between"
- "synthesize", "patterns", "trends", "implications"

Then the goal is NOT achieved unless:
1. Data was collected for ALL entities/topics being compared
2. A synthesis/comparison sub-goal actually COMPLETED (not just data collection)
3. The results summary shows an analytical conclusion, not just raw data

Example - NOT ACHIEVED:
  Goal: "Compare Palantir vs Anduril contracts"
  Results:
    - "Find Palantir contracts": completed, 25 evidence
    - "Find Anduril contracts": completed, 18 evidence
  WRONG: achieved=true (No comparison was performed!)
  RIGHT: achieved=false (Need to run the comparison sub-goal)

Example - ACHIEVED:
  Goal: "Compare Palantir vs Anduril contracts"
  Results:
    - "Find Palantir contracts": completed, 25 evidence
    - "Find Anduril contracts": completed, 18 evidence
    - "Compare contract portfolios": completed (synthesis shows Palantir has 3x more...)
  RIGHT: achieved=true (Comparison was performed)

Consider:
- Do we have enough evidence to answer the goal?
- For comparative goals: Was the comparison/analysis actually performed?
- Are there obvious critical gaps?
- Is continuing likely to add significant new value?
