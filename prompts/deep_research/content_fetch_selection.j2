You are helping select which search results warrant fetching full page content.

**Research Question**: {{ research_question }}

**Budget**: You may select up to {{ max_fetches }} URLs for full content retrieval.

**Search Results** ({{ results | length }} total):
{% for result in results %}
---
**Result {{ loop.index }}**:
- Title: {{ result.title }}
- URL: {{ result.url }}
- Snippet: {{ result.snippet or result.description or "No snippet available" }}
- Source: {{ result.source or "Unknown" }}
{% endfor %}
---

## Your Task

Analyze these search results and decide which URLs would benefit from full page retrieval.

**Fetch full content when**:
- The snippet suggests substantial information relevant to the research question
- The source is an authoritative document (report, filing, official announcement)
- The snippet is truncated and hints at more valuable content
- The page likely contains data, figures, or detailed analysis

**Skip fetching when**:
- The snippet already contains the key information needed
- The source is a general news aggregator or low-value site
- The URL appears to be a paywall, login page, or dynamic app
- Similar content has already been selected from another URL

**Consider**:
- Diversity of sources (don't fetch 5 URLs from the same site)
- Information density (longer articles > short blurbs)
- Relevance to specific aspects of the research question

## Response Format

Return a JSON object:

{% raw %}
{
  "selected_urls": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/article",
      "reason": "Brief explanation of why this URL is worth fetching"
    }
  ],
  "skip_reasoning": "Brief explanation of overall selection strategy and why other URLs were not selected"
}
{% endraw %}

**Important**:
- Return an empty array if no URLs warrant full fetch
- You may select fewer than {{ max_fetches }} if fewer are valuable
- URLs must exactly match the URLs provided in the results above
