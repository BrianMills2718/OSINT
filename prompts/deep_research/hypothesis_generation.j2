Hypothesis Generation Prompt - Phase 3A: Foundation
Generates 1-5 investigative hypotheses for a research subtask

- research_question: The original user research question
- task_query: The specific subtask query
- available_sources: List of available database integrations

Design Philosophy:
- LLM decides hypothesis count (1-5 based on query complexity)
- No hardcoded thresholds (confidence is reasoning-based)
- Full context provided (all available sources shown)

## YOUR TASK: Generate Investigative Hypotheses

Generate **1-{{ max_hypotheses }} investigative hypotheses** for this subtask. Each hypothesis represents a different angle of investigation.

**IMPORTANT**: Adapt the number of hypotheses to query complexity (up to {{ max_hypotheses }} maximum):
- **Simple queries** (1 obvious pathway): Generate 1-2 hypotheses
  - Example: "GS-2210 job series official documentation" → 1 hypothesis (official sources)
- **Factual queries** (multiple known pathways): Generate 2-3 hypotheses
  - Example: "federal cybersecurity job opportunities" → 2 hypotheses (official postings, social discussions)
- **Speculative/complex queries** (many possible angles): Generate 3-{{ max_hypotheses }} hypotheses
  - Example: "NSA classified intelligence programs" → 4-{{ max_hypotheses }} hypotheses (official leaks, whistleblowers, technical research, court filings, contractor disclosures)

---

## HYPOTHESIS STRUCTURE

For each hypothesis, provide:

### 1. Statement (Required)
What are you looking for with this hypothesis?
- Be specific: What information pathway does this hypothesis explore?
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Example: "Official government job postings contain structured listings for cybersecurity roles with clearance requirements"

### 2. Confidence (Required)
How confident are you this pathway will yield results? (0-100%)
- **High confidence (70-100%)**: Well-established sources, factual queries, official documentation
- **Medium confidence (40-69%)**: Informal sources, social discussions, secondary analysis
- **Low confidence (0-39%)**: Speculative pathways, niche sources, requires luck

**Reasoning**: Explain why this confidence level (1 sentence)
- Example: "90% confidence - official job boards are primary source for federal employment"

### 3. Search Strategy (Required)

**Sources** (list of database names):
- Which integrations to query for this hypothesis?
- Prioritize: List most-likely-to-succeed sources first
- Example: ["USAJobs", "ClearanceJobs"] for official job listings

**Signals** (list of keywords/patterns):
- What keywords, phrases, or patterns indicate relevance?
- Be specific: Not just "cybersecurity" but "GS-2210", "IT Cybersecurity Specialist", "TS/SCI clearance"
- Example: ["GS-2210 series", "cybersecurity specialist", "TS/SCI", "Fort Meade", "NSA"]

**Expected Entities** (list of organizations/people/programs/technologies):
- What specific entities do you expect to find if this hypothesis succeeds?
- Organizations: NSA, FBI, CISA, Lockheed Martin, etc.
- People: Edward Snowden, William Binney, etc.
- Programs: PRISM, XKEYSCORE, ECHELON, etc.
- Technologies: DOUBLEPULSAR, EternalBlue, etc.
- Example: ["NSA", "FBI Cyber Division", "CISA", "GS-2210"]

### 4. Exploration Priority (Required)
In what order should this hypothesis be explored? (1 = first, 2 = second, etc.)
- **Priority 1**: Highest confidence × highest expected value
- **Priority 2-3**: Medium confidence or medium value
- **Priority 4-5**: Lower confidence, but might provide unique insights

**Priority Reasoning**: Explain why this exploration order (1 sentence)
- Example: "Priority 1 - official sources have highest success rate for job queries"

---

## GUIDELINES FOR HYPOTHESIS GENERATION

### Diversity (CRITICAL)
- Each hypothesis should explore a **DIFFERENT** investigative angle
- ❌ BAD: "Official job postings", "Government job listings", "Federal employment opportunities" (all the same)
- ✅ GOOD: "Official job postings", "Social media hiring discussions", "Contractor career pages" (distinct pathways)

### Source Selection Strategy
- **Official queries** (jobs, documentation, regulations): Prioritize government databases (USAJobs, SAM.gov)
- **Social queries** (discussions, opinions, trends): Prioritize social media (Twitter, Reddit, Discord)
- **Research queries** (analysis, investigations, leaks): Mix sources (Brave Search for archives, Discord for communities, Twitter for whistleblowers)

### Confidence Calibration
- **Don't artificially inflate confidence**: If a pathway is uncertain, mark it 30-50%
- **High confidence requires**: Well-established source + clear signals + factual query type
- **Low confidence is OK**: Speculative hypotheses can be valuable if they explore unique angles

### Expected Entities
- Be specific: Not "government agencies" but "NSA, FBI, CISA"
- Include variety: Organizations, people, programs, technologies, clearance levels, job titles
- These are **guidance** (not strict requirements): Results can be valuable even if they don't match expected entities

## FINAL REMINDERS

1. **Adapt hypothesis count**: 1-2 for simple, 2-3 for factual, 3-5 for speculative
2. **Ensure diversity**: Each hypothesis explores a DIFFERENT angle
3. **Be honest with confidence**: Don't inflate - low confidence is acceptable if pathway is valuable
4. **Explain reasoning**: Every confidence score and priority needs 1-sentence justification
5. **Expected entities are guidance**: Results can be valuable even if entities don't match
