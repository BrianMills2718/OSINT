## TASK: Create Structured Synthesis Report

Return a JSON object with the following structure. **CRITICAL**: Every claim MUST have inline citations with URLs.

### Schema Requirements:

```json

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE GROUPING (LLM Intelligence Required)

**DO NOT use hardcoded labels like [PRIMARY], [ANALYSIS], [LEAD].**

Instead, intelligently group sources based on:
1. **Authority level**: Official government sources vs industry analysis vs community discussions
2. **Source type**: Job boards vs news articles vs official documents vs social media
3. **Reliability**: Verified data vs aggregated analysis vs user experiences
4. **Relevance**: Direct answers vs contextual information vs background

**Example intelligent groupings**:
- "Official Government Publications" (USAJobs postings, SAM.gov contracts, DVIDS releases)
- "Industry Job Market Analysis" (ClearanceJobs aggregated data, market reports)
- "Community Insights and Experiences" (Reddit discussions, Discord conversations)
- "News and Media Coverage" (Brave Search news articles)

**Your task**: Analyze the sources in the findings and create meaningful groups with descriptive names.

---

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR INLINE CITATIONS (MANDATORY)

**Every claim MUST have at least one inline citation.**

Good examples:
- ✅ "Cleared cybersecurity roles require TS/SCI clearance for NSA positions" with citation to specific USAJobs posting
- ✅ "Contractor positions show $120K-$160K salary ranges" with citation to ClearanceJobs analysis
- ✅ "Reddit users report 6-month delays for polygraph clearances" with citation to specific Reddit thread

Bad examples:
- ❌ "Many cleared positions require TS/SCI" (no citation - which source?)
- ❌ "Salaries are competitive" (vague + no citation)

---

## SYNTHESIS GUIDANCE

**Temporal Precision**:
- If research question mentions "2024", clarify if results cover FY2024 (Oct 2023-Sep 2024) or CY2024
- Use specific dates when available, not vague terms like "recent" or "lately"

**Terminology Interpretation**:
- If technical terms, acronyms, or jargon have multiple meanings, state which interpretation the results reflect
- Example: "RMF" could mean Risk Management Framework or other acronyms - clarify which

**Scope Clarity**:
- If results extend beyond or fall short of query scope, note this in limitations_noted
- Example: Query asked about "government contracts" but only DoD contracts were found

**What NOT to Include in Final Report**:
- ❌ Information gaps (these go to metadata.json and logs, not user-facing report)
- ❌ Contradictions requiring resolution (debugging data for logs)
- ❌ LLM decision-making process details (goes to execution_log.jsonl)

**Focus on**:
- ✅ Clear, verifiable claims with inline citations
- ✅ Intelligent source grouping with reliability context
- ✅ Entity relationships and connections
- ✅ Timeline of key events (if dates available)
- ✅ Clean, useful report for investigator

## QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE RETURNING

1. **Citation Check**: Does every claim in executive_summary.key_points and source_groups[].findings[] have at least one inline_citation?
2. **Source Grouping**: Did you create intelligent group names (not hardcoded labels)?
3. **Reliability Context**: Did you assess each group's reliability and strengths?
4. **Entity Context**: Did you explain why each key entity matters to the research question?
5. **Completeness**: Did you include all required fields from the schema?

Set `synthesis_quality_check.all_claims_have_citations` to `true` only if you verified every claim has citations.

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown, no explanations, just valid JSON matching the schema above.
