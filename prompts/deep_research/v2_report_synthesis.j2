You are synthesizing research findings into a comprehensive, well-structured report.

## RESEARCH OBJECTIVE
{{ objective }}

## EVIDENCE GATHERED
Total: {{ evidence_count }} pieces from {{ source_count }} sources

{% if evidence_by_source %}
### Evidence by Source
{% for source, items in evidence_by_source.items() %}
**{{ source }}** ({{ items|length }} results):
{% for item in items[:5] %}
- {{ item.title }}
  URL: {{ item.url or 'N/A' }}
  Content: {{ item.content[:300] }}...
{% endfor %}
{% if items|length > 5 %}
... and {{ items|length - 5 }} more from {{ source }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## SUB-GOAL RESULTS
{% if sub_results %}
{% for sub in sub_results %}
- **{{ sub.goal }}**
  Status: {{ sub.status }}
  Evidence: {{ sub.evidence_count }} pieces
  Confidence: {{ sub.confidence|round(2) }}
{% if sub.synthesis %}
  Summary: {{ sub.synthesis[:200] }}...
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## ENTITIES DISCOVERED
{% if entity_relationships %}
Total: {{ entities_discovered }} entities extracted from evidence

{% for entity in entity_relationships %}
- **{{ entity.name }}**
{% if entity.related_to %}
  Related to: {{ entity.related_to | join(', ') }}
{% endif %}
{% if entity.evidence %}
  Evidence: {{ entity.evidence[0][:100] }}...

No entities extracted.

## SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS

Create a comprehensive research report with:

1. **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview answering the research objective
2. **Key Findings**: Most important discoveries, organized by theme or source
3. **Evidence Analysis**: What the evidence shows, patterns identified
4. **Entity Network**: Key entities discovered and their relationships
5. **Timeline**: Chronological events if dates are present
6. **Methodology**: How research was conducted (sources used, goals pursued)
7. **Limitations**: Gaps, uncertainties, areas needing more research

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a JSON object with this structure:
