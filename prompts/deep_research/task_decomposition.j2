Break this complex research question into 3-5 specific, focused research ANGLES.

**CURRENT DATE: {{ current_date }} (Year: {{ current_year }})**
- "Recent" = last 1-2 years ({{ current_year - 1 }} to {{ current_year }})
- "Current" or "this year" = {{ current_year }}
- If no year specified, default to recent (last 1-2 years)

# AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES

Understanding what sources we have access to helps you identify which angles are investigable. Think about what each source can provide when decomposing the question.

## Government & Official Sources
- **SAM.gov**: Federal contract awards, vendor registrations, procurement opportunities
- **USAspending**: Federal spending data, awarded contracts, grants, budget information
- **USAJobs**: Official federal government job postings with clearance requirements
- **ClearanceJobs**: Specialized job board for cleared positions (Secret, TS/SCI)
- **DVIDS**: Defense Visual Information - military press releases, photos, videos, unit news
- **FBI Vault**: FBI's FOIA library of declassified documents and investigations
- **CIA CREST**: CIA's Reading Room of declassified documents
- **Federal Register**: Official regulations, proposed rules, executive orders, agency notices
- **Congress.gov**: Legislation, bills, Congressional Record, committee reports
- **GovInfo**: GAO reports, Inspector General audits, Congressional hearings
- **SEC EDGAR**: Corporate financial filings (10-K, 8-K), executive compensation, ownership

## Legal & Investigative Sources
- **CourtListener**: Federal and state court opinions, dockets, legal filings
- **FEC**: Campaign finance data, political contributions, lobbying disclosures
- **ICIJ Offshore Leaks**: Panama Papers, Paradise Papers - offshore financial data
- **ProPublica**: Investigative journalism, nonprofit data, government accountability

## Social & Community Sources
- **Twitter**: Real-time discussions, officials, journalists, whistleblowers
- **Reddit**: Community discussions, insider perspectives, expert commentary
- **Discord**: OSINT communities (Bellingcat, Project OWL), geopolitics, intelligence
- **Telegram**: Encrypted messaging channels, international sources

## Web & News Sources
- **Brave Search**: General web search - news, analysis, historical context
- **NewsAPI**: Aggregated news articles from thousands of sources worldwide
- **Wayback Machine**: Historical snapshots of websites and documents

**Use this source awareness to identify angles you might not otherwise think of.** For example, if investigating contractor misconduct, knowing we have CourtListener (lawsuits), FEC (political contributions), and SEC EDGAR (enforcement actions) suggests angles beyond just contract data.

# OUTPUT FORMAT RULES

**CRITICAL: Your output should be research ANGLES, not source-specific queries.**

DO NOT include:
- Source names in your output (e.g., "SAM.gov", "USAspending", "CourtListener")
- Search syntax or operators
- Site filters or URL references

DO include:
- The TOPIC or FACET to investigate
- Sufficient context to understand the angle
- Natural language descriptions

Example - WRONG:
- "Federal AI contracts 2024 SAM.gov USAspending"  ← Contains source names!
- "site:sec.gov enforcement actions"  ← Contains search syntax!

Example - CORRECT:
- "Federal AI contract awards in 2024"  ← Topic only, no source names
- "SEC enforcement actions against defense contractors"  ← Topic only

The downstream system will decide which sources to query for each angle.

# DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY

Focus on distinct research ANGLES (different facets of the question), not entity permutations:

**Less effective (entity-focused):**
- "Donald Trump F-35 sales"
- "Mohammed bin Salman F-35 sales"
- "US Congress F-35 sales"
(Three angles asking the same question about different actors)

**More effective (angle-focused):**
- "Executive branch policy decisions on F-35 Saudi Arabia arms sale"
- "Congressional oversight and legislative debate on F-35 Saudi sale"
- "Geopolitical implications - Israel security concerns, regional balance of power"
(Three angles exploring different FACETS: policy, oversight, strategic impact)

# SPECIFICITY GUIDANCE

Be specific enough to be useful, but not so narrow that you miss relevant information:

**Too broad:**
- "United States" → Matches millions of documents
- "F-35 fighter jet" → Everything about F-35s

**Just right:**
- "US executive branch arms export policy decisions 2024"
- "F-35 foreign military sales controversy and congressional debate"

**Too narrow:**
- "Trump tweet about F-35 on March 15 2024" → Too specific, may miss related content

# OUTPUT

Return 3-5 research angles in priority order (most important first).

Each angle should:
1. Explore a DISTINCT facet of the research question
2. Be specific enough to yield focused results
3. NOT contain source names or search syntax
