Break this complex research question into 3-5 specific, focused search tasks.

Research Question: {{ question }}

Each task should be:
- A clear, searchable query (can be used with database search or web search)
- Focused on one aspect of the overall question
- Likely to return concrete results (not too broad, not too narrow)
- Simple keyword-based queries (avoid complex Boolean operators like OR, AND, NOT)
- No site filters (site:gov) or date ranges (2015..2025) - these reduce results
- Natural language queries work best (e.g., "government surveillance contracts Palantir" instead of "site:gov contract Palantir OR Clearview")

IMPORTANT - Query Intent:
- For definitional queries (what is X?), create subtasks that seek OFFICIAL DESCRIPTIONS and DOCUMENTATION, not examples of content
- For content queries (what content does X provide?), ask about CONTENT CATEGORIES and TYPES, not specific examples
- Example (CORRECT): "Find official documentation about DVIDS mission and purpose" → targets reference material
- Example (WRONG): "DVIDS photos videos multimedia gallery" → targets event media, not documentation

Return tasks in priority order (most important first).
