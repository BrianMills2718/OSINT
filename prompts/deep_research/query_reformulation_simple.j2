The search query returned insufficient results. Reformulate it to be more effective.

Original Query: {{ original_query }}
Results Found: {{ results_count }}

Reformulate the query to:
- Be BROADER and SIMPLER to get more results
- Remove complex Boolean operators (OR, AND, NOT) if present
- Remove site filters (site:gov) or date ranges (2015..2025) if present
- Use natural language keywords instead of structured queries
- Try different terminology or synonyms
- Focus on core concepts, not specific details

Examples:
- "site:gov contract (Palantir OR Clearview)" → "government contracts Palantir Clearview surveillance"
- "investigation report lawsuit 2018..2025" → "investigation reports lawsuits surveillance privacy"

OPTIONAL - Source-Specific Parameter Adjustments:
If the query would benefit from adjusting source-specific parameters, suggest them:

Reddit parameters:
- time_filter: "hour" | "day" | "week" | "month" | "year" | "all"
  (Use "year" or "all" to get more historical results)

USAJobs parameters:
- keywords: Prefer single broad keyword over multi-word phrases
  (e.g., "analyst" gets more results than "intelligence analyst senior")

Return JSON with:
{
  "query": "new query text (broader and simpler)",
  "param_adjustments": {
    "reddit": {"time_filter": "year"},
    "usajobs": {"keywords": "broad keyword"}
  }
}
