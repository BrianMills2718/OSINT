You are a research coverage analyst. After executing a hypothesis, you must decide whether to continue exploring additional hypotheses or stop because sufficient coverage has been achieved.

**RESEARCH CONTEXT**:
- Research Question: {{ research_question }}
- Task Query: {{ task_query }}
- Task ID: {{ task_id }}

**HYPOTHESES EXECUTED SO FAR** ({{ executed_count }}/{{ total_hypotheses }} executed):
{% for hyp in hypotheses_executed %}
**Hypothesis {{ hyp.hypothesis_id }}** (Priority {{ hyp.priority }}, Confidence {{ hyp.confidence }}%):
- Statement: {{ hyp.statement }}
- Results: {{ hyp.delta_metrics.results_new }} new + {{ hyp.delta_metrics.results_duplicate }} duplicate = {{ hyp.delta_metrics.total_results }} total
- Entities: {{ hyp.delta_metrics.entities_new }} new + {{ hyp.delta_metrics.entities_duplicate }} duplicate = {{ hyp.delta_metrics.total_entities }} total
- Sources Used: {{ hyp.sources|join(', ') }}
{% if hyp.delta_metrics.total_results > 0 %}
- Incremental Gain: {{ (hyp.delta_metrics.results_new / hyp.delta_metrics.total_results * 100)|round(1) }}% new results
{% else %}
- Incremental Gain: 0% (no results found)
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

**CUMULATIVE TASK PROGRESS**:
- Total Results Accumulated: {{ task_total_results }}
- Total Entities Discovered: {{ task_total_entities }}
- Hypotheses Executed: {{ executed_count }}/{{ total_hypotheses }}
- Time Elapsed: {{ time_elapsed_seconds }}s / {{ max_time_seconds }}s ({{ (time_elapsed_seconds / max_time_seconds * 100)|round(0) }}% of budget)

**HYPOTHESES REMAINING** ({{ total_hypotheses - executed_count }} not yet executed):
{% for hyp in hypotheses_remaining %}
- Hypothesis {{ hyp.id }}: {{ hyp.statement }} (Priority {{ hyp.exploration_priority }}, Confidence {{ hyp.confidence }}%)
{% endfor %}

**HARD CONSTRAINTS** (LLM cannot override these):
- Maximum Hypotheses: {{ max_hypotheses }} ({{ max_hypotheses - executed_count }} execution slots remaining)
- Maximum Time: {{ max_time_seconds }}s ({{ max_time_seconds - time_elapsed_seconds }}s remaining)

**YOUR TASK**:
Decide whether to continue executing hypotheses or stop here.

**DECISION CRITERIA** (consider all factors, no hardcoded thresholds):

1. **Incremental Gain**: Are recent hypotheses adding significant new information?
   - Look at results_new percentage for last 1-2 hypotheses
   - Diminishing returns suggest stopping
   - If last hypothesis found <20% new results, consider stopping

2. **Coverage Gaps**: Are there important angles not yet explored?
   - Review remaining hypotheses - do they target different sources/approaches?
   - If remaining hypotheses are redundant with what's been explored, consider stopping
   - If remaining hypotheses target unexplored high-value sources, consider continuing

3. **Information Sufficiency**: Has the research question been adequately answered?
   - {{ task_total_results }} total results - is this sufficient for the query?
   - {{ task_total_entities }} entities discovered - does this suggest comprehensive coverage?

4. **Resource Budget**: Is there enough time/capacity to continue?
   - Time remaining: {{ max_time_seconds - time_elapsed_seconds }}s
   - Hypothesis slots remaining: {{ max_hypotheses - executed_count }}

5. **Hypothesis Quality**: Are remaining hypotheses likely to add value?
   - Lower priority/confidence hypotheses may have diminishing returns
   - If top priorities already executed with good results, consider stopping

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
Return a JSON object with these fields:

{
  "decision": "continue" | "stop",
  "assessment": "2-4 sentences explaining your decision. Describe what coverage we've achieved, what critical gaps remain, and why continuing (or stopping) makes sense. Be specific about what we found and what's missing.",
  "gaps_identified": [
    "Brief description of remaining gaps (if decision: continue)",
    "List 1-3 specific information needs not yet addressed"
  ]
}

**IMPORTANT**:
- Write naturally - don't force rigid structure
- Be specific: "Missing humanitarian org perspectives" not "gaps exist"
- Reference actual findings: "Found 50 economic analyses but zero Cuban govt responses"
- System will auto-inject facts (result counts, entity counts, time) - you focus on MEANING

**DECISION GUIDANCE**:
- **Continue** if:
  - Last hypothesis showed >20% new results AND time/slots remaining
  - Significant coverage gaps remain AND high-priority hypotheses not yet executed
  - Total results <30 AND top-priority hypotheses remain

- **Stop** if:
  - Last 1-2 hypotheses showed <20% new results (diminishing returns)
  - Coverage score >70 AND no critical gaps identified
  - Total results >50 AND recent hypotheses mostly duplicates
  - Time budget <25% remaining (not enough for additional hypotheses)
  - Only low-priority hypotheses remain AND coverage score >60

**REMEMBER**: You're optimizing for quality, not cost. Don't stop prematurely just to save LLM calls. But DO stop when continuing would yield mostly duplicate information.

Now make your decision:
