Extract key entities (people, organizations, programs, operations) from these search results.

CONTEXT:
- Original research question: "{{ research_question }}"
- Search query used: "{{ task_query }}"

Use the context to disambiguate acronyms and focus on entities relevant to the research question.

Results (numbered for reference):
{{ results_text }}

**IMPORTANT**: For each entity, provide:
1. **name**: The entity name (standardized form)
2. **source_indices**: Which result(s) mention this entity (e.g., [0, 2] if Result #0 and #2 mention it)
3. **evidence**: Brief quote or paraphrase proving the entity exists in the results

This allows verification - every entity must be traceable back to a source.

Return JSON with this structure:
{% raw %}
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Entity Name",
      "source_indices": [0, 2],
      "evidence": "brief quote or paraphrase from results"
    }
  ]
}
{% endraw %}

Focus on 3-10 named entities that:
1. Are RELEVANT to the research question
2. Could be researched further
3. Are ACTUALLY MENTIONED in the results (not inferred)
4. Match the domain of the research question

Example output for "NSA cybersecurity contracts":
{% raw %}
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Palantir Technologies",
      "source_indices": [0, 3],
      "evidence": "Palantir awarded $45M NSA contract for data analytics"
    },
    {
      "name": "Booz Allen Hamilton",
      "source_indices": [1],
      "evidence": "Booz Allen supports NSA cybersecurity operations"
    }
  ]
}
{% endraw %}

DO NOT extract:
- Generic entities unrelated to the research question
- Entities not explicitly mentioned in the results (no hallucination)
- Common words or phrases that aren't named entities
