Extract key entities (people, organizations, programs, operations) from these search results.

CONTEXT:
- Original research question: "{{ research_question }}"
- Search query used: "{{ task_query }}"

Use the context to disambiguate acronyms and focus on entities relevant to the research question.

Results:
{{ results_text }}

Return a JSON list of entity names (3-10 entities). Focus on named entities that:
1. Are RELEVANT to the research question
2. Could be researched further
3. Match the domain of the research question (e.g., if researching cybersecurity contracts, focus on companies, agencies, programs in that domain)

Examples (matching the research domain):
- Research question about "JSOC operations" → ["Joint Special Operations Command", "CIA", "Operation Cyclone"]
- Research question about "NSA cybersecurity contracts" → ["National Security Agency", "Palantir", "Booz Allen Hamilton", "Leidos"]
- Research question about "FBI surveillance programs" → ["Federal Bureau of Investigation", "PRISM", "FISA Court"]

DO NOT extract generic entities unrelated to the research question.
