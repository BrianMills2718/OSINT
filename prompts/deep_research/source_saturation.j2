You are deciding whether to continue querying {{ source_name }} or if the source is saturated.

HYPOTHESIS: {{ hypothesis_statement }}

SOURCE: {{ source_name }}

SOURCE CHARACTERISTICS:
{{ source_metadata | tojson(indent=2) }}

QUERY HISTORY:
{% for query_attempt in query_history %}
{{ loop.index }}. Query: "{{ query_attempt.query }}"
   Results: {{ query_attempt.results_total }} total, {{ query_attempt.results_accepted }} accepted, {{ query_attempt.results_rejected }} rejected{% if query_attempt.results_duplicate %}, {{ query_attempt.results_duplicate }} duplicates{% endif %}
   Effectiveness: {{ (query_attempt.effectiveness * 100) | round(1) }}%
   {% if query_attempt.rejection_themes %}
   Rejection themes: {{ query_attempt.rejection_themes | join(', ') }}
   {% endif %}
{% else %}
No queries executed yet (this is the first query).
{% endfor %}

TOTAL RESULTS SO FAR: {{ total_results_accepted }} accepted across {{ query_history | length }} queries

CURRENT GAPS:
{% if information_gaps %}
{% for gap in information_gaps %}
- {{ gap }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
No specific gaps identified.
{% endif %}

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

**SATURATED** if:
1. High confidence we've found all relevant information that exists
2. Recent queries yielding only duplicates or off-topic results
3. Information clearly doesn't exist in this source
4. Queries are repeating similar patterns without new results
5. Diminishing returns evident (effectiveness dropping)

**CONTINUE** if:
1. Reasonable chance different query formulation could find more
2. Identified gaps that could be addressed with targeted queries
3. Source characteristics suggest more depth available
4. Haven't tried key query strategies yet
5. Recent queries still productive (finding new results)

SATURATION GUIDANCE:
- **Query effectiveness**: Are we getting better or worse results over time?
- **Terminology learning**: Have we found keywords/phrases that work well?
- **Information existence**: Does the info likely exist in this source given its nature?
- **Diminishing returns**: Are new queries adding meaningful value?
- **Pattern recognition**: If 3+ queries yield no new results → likely saturated
- **Quality decline**: If results declining in relevance/quality → likely saturated
- **Duplicate signals**: If hitting mostly duplicates → likely saturated
- **Source depth**: Consider source characteristics (e.g., Twitter saturates quickly, SAM.gov has deep archives)

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Be **adaptive**: Different sources saturate at different rates
- Be **evidence-based**: Use query history trends, not arbitrary thresholds
- Be **goal-oriented**: Focus on addressing the hypothesis, not exhaustive searching
- Be **resource-aware**: Balance thoroughness with efficiency

Return JSON:
{
    "decision": "SATURATED" or "CONTINUE",
    "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining your decision based on the query history and source characteristics",
    "confidence": 0-100,  // Confidence in this decision (0=uncertain, 100=very confident)
    "existence_confidence": 0-100,  // Confidence information exists in source (0=unlikely, 100=very likely)
    "next_query_suggestion": "If CONTINUE, specific query to try next (empty if SATURATED)",
    "next_query_reasoning": "If CONTINUE, why this query should work (empty if SATURATED)",
    "expected_value": "high" | "medium" | "low",  // Expected value of next query
    "remaining_gaps": [...]  // Updated list of specific info gaps still unaddressed (can be same as input or modified)
}

**If CONTINUE**: Provide a SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE query that targets identified gaps or uses a different strategy than previous queries. Do not repeat failed approaches.

**If SATURATED**: Explain what led to saturation (e.g., repeated duplicates, exhausted strategies, info doesn't exist).
