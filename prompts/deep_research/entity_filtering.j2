You are filtering entities extracted during a research investigation.

CONTEXT:
- Research Question: "{{ research_question }}"
- Total Tasks Completed: {{ tasks_completed }}
- Total Entities Extracted: {{ total_entities }}

EXTRACTED ENTITIES (with task occurrence counts):
{{ entities_with_counts }}

YOUR TASK:
Filter out low-value entities while preserving important ones.

FILTERING CRITERIA:

KEEP entities that are:
- Specific organizations, agencies, or companies (e.g., "NSA", "Lockheed Martin", "FBI")
- Specific job titles or roles (e.g., "IT Specialist (Cybersecurity)", "Special Agent")
- Specific technical terms or certifications (e.g., "TS/SCI", "CISSP", "2210 Series")
- Specific locations, programs, or initiatives (e.g., "Fort Meade", "Cyber Command")
- Entities appearing in MULTIPLE tasks (higher confidence - cross-task confirmation)

REMOVE entities that are:
- Generic/meta terms about the research domain (e.g., "cybersecurity", "job", "federal government", "defense contractor")
- Overly broad categories (e.g., "government", "contractor", "clearance")
- Query keywords rephrased (e.g., if query is about "cybersecurity jobs", remove "cybersecurity" and "job")
- Entities appearing in only 1 task (unless {{ tasks_completed }} == 1)

EXAMPLES:

Research: "What defense contractor jobs require TS/SCI clearance?"
KEEP: ["Northrop Grumman", "Lockheed Martin", "TS/SCI with Poly", "Fort Meade", "Special Agent"]
REMOVE: ["defense contractor", "clearance", "job", "cybersecurity", "government"]

Research: "What are NSA cybersecurity job series?"
KEEP: ["NSA", "IT Specialist (Cybersecurity)", "2210 Series", "Fort Meade", "CISSP"]
REMOVE: ["cybersecurity", "job series", "federal government", "information security"]

IMPORTANT:
- Prefer specificity over generality
- Keep entities that provide investigative leads (names, places, programs)
- Remove entities that are just rephrased query terms
- Multi-task entities (appearing in 2+ tasks) have higher value - keep them unless they're clearly generic

Return JSON with filtered entities and reasoning.
