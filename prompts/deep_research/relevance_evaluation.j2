Evaluate whether these search results are relevant to the research question.

Original Research Question: "{{ research_question }}"
Search Query Used: "{{ task_query }}"

Sample Results:
{{ results_text }}

Score the relevance of these results on a scale of 0-10:
- 10: Highly relevant - directly answers the research question
- 7-9: Relevant - related to the topic but may be indirect
- 4-6: Somewhat relevant - mentions key terms but not focused on the topic
- 1-3: Barely relevant - only tangentially related
- 0: Completely off-topic - wrong domain or subject matter entirely

IMPORTANT - Partial Relevance Scoring:
Score based on the PERCENTAGE of relevant results in the sample:
- 80-100% relevant results: Score 8-10
- 60-80% relevant results: Score 6-8
- 40-60% relevant results: Score 4-6
- 20-40% relevant results: Score 2-4
- 0-20% relevant results: Score 0-2

Examples:
- If 7 out of 10 results are on-topic (70%): Score 6-7, not 0
- If 3 out of 10 results are relevant (30%): Score 2-3, not 0
- If ALL 10 results are off-topic (0%): Score 0

IMPORTANT - Entity/Domain Mismatches:
- If the results are about a DIFFERENT entity with the same acronym (e.g., "Naval Support Activity" when asked about "National Security Agency"), score 0-2 (wrong entity).
- If the results are in the wrong domain (e.g., military logistics when asked about cybersecurity contracts), score 0-3.
