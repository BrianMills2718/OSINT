## YOUR TASK

Determine if this research has reached **saturation** - the point where continuing would yield mostly duplicates, peripheral information, or negligible new insights.

### **SATURATION INDICATORS**

Check for these patterns (multiple indicators = higher confidence):

#### **1. Diminishing Returns** (STRONG signal for saturation):
- Last 3+ tasks yielding <15% new results? (Mostly duplicates)
- Coverage scores plateaued? (No increase in last 3 tasks)
- Entity discovery rate dropped? (<2 new entities per recent task)
- Incremental value declining? (100% → 80% → 60% → 40%)

#### **2. Coverage Completeness** (MODERATE signal):
- Average coverage across tasks >70%?
- No critical gaps in recent coverage decisions?
- All major topic dimensions explored?
- Recent tasks only filling minor details?

#### **3. Pending Queue Quality** (MODERATE signal):
- Remaining tasks all Priority 6-10? (Low value)
- Estimated redundancy >60% for most pending tasks?
- No high-confidence unexplored angles remaining?
- Follow-ups becoming increasingly tangential?

#### **4. Topic Exhaustion** (STRONG signal):
- Same sources re-queried with similar queries?
- Follow-up generator creating <2 follow-ups per task?
- Gaps identified are peripheral? (Not core to research question)
- Results from last 2-3 tasks mostly confirming existing findings?

### **IMPORTANT CONTEXT**

**This is quality-first research** - don't rush to declare saturation:
- User prefers thoroughness over speed/cost
- False positive (stopping too early) is worse than false negative (continuing)
- When uncertain, err toward "NOT saturated"

**However**, genuine saturation DOES occur:
- If last 3 tasks all <10% new results → clearly saturated
- If coverage >75% and all pending tasks Priority 7-10 → likely saturated
- If zero follow-ups created from last 2 tasks → possibly saturated

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### **Declare SATURATED if**:
- **Strong evidence of diminishing returns** (last 3 tasks <15% new results)
  **AND** (Coverage >65% OR pending queue all low-priority)

- **OR** Coverage >80% AND no critical gaps remain

- **OR** Last 3 tasks found <5% new results (extreme redundancy)

### **Declare NOT SATURATED if**:
- Recent tasks still yielding >30% new results
- **OR** Critical gaps identified in recent coverage decisions
- **OR** High-priority (P1-3) tasks remain in queue
- **OR** Average coverage <60%
- **OR** Only completed <5 tasks (too early to assess)

### **RECOMMENDATIONS**

If NOT saturated, recommend:
- **continue_full**: Normal expansion (5+ more tasks likely valuable)
- **continue_limited**: Approaching saturation (2-3 more tasks to close specific gaps)

If SATURATED:
- **stop**: Research complete, continuing would waste resources

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return JSON with saturation assessment:

```json
{
  "saturated": true | false,
  "confidence": 0-100,  // How confident in this determination
  "rationale": "2-3 sentences explaining saturation decision based on indicators above",
  "evidence": {
    "diminishing_returns": true | false,  // Last 3 tasks <15% new results
    "coverage_completeness": true | false,  // Avg coverage >70%
    "pending_queue_quality": "high" | "medium" | "low",  // Remaining task value
    "topic_exhaustion": true | false  // Re-querying same angles
  },
  "recommendation": "stop" | "continue_limited" | "continue_full",
  "recommended_additional_tasks": 0-10,  // If continue, how many more tasks
  "critical_gaps_remaining": [
    "Brief description of any critical gaps (if not saturated)"
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Be honest about saturation even if <max_tasks
- Don't artificially continue just to use budget
- Quality > quantity

Now assess saturation.
