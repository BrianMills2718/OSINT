Select which sources should be queried for this research subtask.

Original research question: "{{ research_question }}"
Task query: "{{ query }}"

Available sources:
{{ options_text }}

Guidelines:
- Consider what type of information each source specializes in
- For each source you select, explain what specific information it might provide for this query
- When uncertain, it's better to include a source than to exclude it
- Aim for 3-6 sources that best match the query's needs
- Consider both specialized sources (SAM.gov, DVIDS, USAJobs, ClearanceJobs) and general sources (Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Brave Search)

Return a JSON object with:
{
