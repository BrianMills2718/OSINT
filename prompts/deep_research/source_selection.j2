Select which sources should be queried for this research subtask.

Original research question: "{{ research_question }}"
Task query: "{{ query }}"

Available sources (use the ID in parentheses):
{{ options_text }}

Guidelines:
- Consider what type of information each source specializes in
- For each source you select, explain what specific information it might provide for this query
- When uncertain, it's better to include a source than to exclude it
- Aim for 3-6 sources that best match the query's needs
- Consider both specialized sources and general sources

IMPORTANT: Return the source ID (the value in parentheses), NOT the display name.
For example, use "govinfo" not "GovInfo", use "sam" not "SAM.gov".

Return a JSON object with:
{
  "sources": ["source_id_1", "source_id_2", ...],
  "reason": "Brief explanation of why these sources were selected"
}
