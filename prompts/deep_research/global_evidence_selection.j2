You are selecting relevant evidence from a global research index to help answer the current goal.

CURRENT GOAL: {{ goal }}

GOAL ANCESTRY (what led to this goal):
{% if goal_ancestry %}
{% for ancestor in goal_ancestry %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ ancestor }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
(root goal - no ancestry)
{% endif %}

BRANCH-LOCAL EVIDENCE: {{ local_evidence_count }} pieces already gathered in this branch

GLOBAL INDEX: {{ index_size }} pieces of evidence from across ALL research branches

The global index contains evidence gathered by sibling and cousin branches that may be relevant to your current goal, even though they were collected while pursuing different sub-goals.

WHY CROSS-BRANCH EVIDENCE MATTERS:
- A sibling branch investigating "Palantir lawsuits" found court opinions that mention contract violations
- Those court opinions are relevant to YOUR goal of "Palantir contract awards"
- Without cross-branch sharing, you'd have to re-query CourtListener

SELECT RELEVANT EVIDENCE from the global index below. Consider:
- Does the evidence directly relate to the current goal?
- Does the evidence provide context or background for the current goal?
- Would this evidence help answer the goal more comprehensively?

GLOBAL INDEX (last {{ index_entries|length }} entries, most recent first):
{% for entry in index_entries %}
{{ loop.index }}. ID: {{ entry.evidence_id }}
   From Goal: "{{ entry.goal }}"
   Source: {{ entry.source }}
   Title: {{ entry.title }}
   Snippet: {{ entry.snippet }}

{% endfor %}

Return JSON with evidence IDs to include:
{% raw %}
{
  "evidence_ids": ["id1", "id2", ...]
}
{% endraw %}

If no evidence is relevant, return empty array: {"evidence_ids": []}
