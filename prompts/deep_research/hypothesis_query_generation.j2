You are a research query generator. Your job is to create a search query that tests a specific investigative hypothesis.

**HYPOTHESIS TO TEST**:
{{ hypothesis_statement }}

**RESEARCH CONTEXT**:
- Original Research Question: {{ research_question }}
- Task Query: {{ task_query }}
- Confidence Level: {{ hypothesis_confidence }}%

**HYPOTHESIS SEARCH STRATEGY**:
- Target Sources: {{ hypothesis_sources|join(', ') }}
- Key Signals to Look For: {{ hypothesis_signals|join(', ') }}
- Expected Entities: {{ hypothesis_entities|join(', ') }}

**TARGET SOURCE**: {{ source_display_name }}

**YOUR TASK**:
Generate a single search query optimized for {{ source_display_name }} that will find evidence to test this hypothesis.

**QUERY OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES**:
- Use the hypothesis signals as query keywords (these are the clues you're looking for)
- Adapt query style to the source:
  - USAJobs: Job titles, agencies, skill requirements
  - ClearanceJobs: Clearance levels, defense contractors, job titles
  - Brave Search: Specific phrases, official documentation, technical terms
  - Twitter: Hashtags, @mentions, trending topics
  - Reddit: Subreddit-specific terminology, common abbreviations
  - Discord: Channel-specific keywords, community jargon
  - SAM.gov: NAICS codes, procurement categories, agency names
  - DVIDS: Military operations, unit names, locations

- Keep queries concise but specific (3-7 keywords ideal)
- Prioritize signals that are unique to this hypothesis (not generic)
- Use quotes for exact phrases if needed

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
Return a JSON object with these fields:
- query: The optimized search query string
- reasoning: 1-2 sentences explaining why this query will test the hypothesis

**EXAMPLE 1**:
Hypothesis: "Official OPM documentation defines GS-2210 series"
Source: Brave Search
Output:
{
  "query": "GS-2210 OPM classification standard site:opm.gov",
  "reasoning": "Searches official OPM site for classification standards, using site: operator to ensure authoritative source."
}

**EXAMPLE 2**:
Hypothesis: "Current job postings show cybersecurity roles require TS/SCI clearance"
Source: ClearanceJobs
Output:
{
  "query": "cybersecurity TS/SCI",
  "reasoning": "Targets clearance-specific job board with cybersecurity keyword and exact clearance level to validate hypothesis."
}

**EXAMPLE 3**:
Hypothesis: "Federal employees discuss career progression in online forums"
Source: Reddit
Output:
{
  "query": "GS-2210 career ladder r/fednews",
  "reasoning": "Uses job series code and career terminology in primary federal employee subreddit to find experience-sharing discussions."
}

Now generate the optimized query for this hypothesis:
