# KlipNews AI Automation Roadmap
**Prepared by**: Brian Mills
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Purpose**: Outline AI automation capabilities for investigative journalism research at KlipNews

---

## Overview

I can help KlipNews automate investigative journalism research through AI and automation. This breaks down into 5 main activities:

1. **Identify topics of interest** - What should we investigate?
2. **Retrieve information** - Get the data
3. **Aggregate and analyze** - Make sense of it
4. **Write up the information** - Create drafts
5. **Distribute and promote** - Get it out there

---

## 1. Identify Topics of Interest

### What I Can Do Now âœ…

**Daily Automated Monitoring** (Already Running in Production):
- System checks 8 government databases every morning at 6:00 AM
- Monitors 49 curated investigative keywords across 6 topic areas:
  - Surveillance & FISA Programs (e.g., "Section 702", "FISA warrant")
  - Special Operations & Covert Programs (e.g., "JSOC", "Title 50 covert action")
  - Domestic Extremism Classifications (e.g., "Nihilistic Violent Extremism")
  - Immigration Enforcement Operations
  - Inspector General & Oversight Reports
  - Your specific custom topics
- **Automatically emails you** when new relevant information appears
- **Smart filtering**: AI scores each result 0-10 for relevance, only sends you the good stuff (6+/10)
- **Prevents false alarms**: Filters out irrelevant results (like event names that happen to contain your keywords)

**Current Databases Being Monitored**:
- DVIDS (military media/photos)
- Federal Register (new government rules)
- SAM.gov (government contracts)
- USAJobs (government job postings)
- Twitter (via keyword search)
- Discord (OSINT communities like Bellingcat)

**What This Means**:
You wake up to an email digest of new government contracts, regulations, military activities, job postings, and social media chatter related to your investigative beatsâ€”every single day, automatically.

### What I'm Building Now ðŸ”¨

**Tag System & Keyword Index**:
- Extract topics from your existing KlipNews article tags (you have 3,300+ tags)
- Create structured topic categories based on what you actually cover
- Build comprehensive keyword index to guide automated searches
- Link keywords to journalist interests/beats

**Example**: If KlipNews covers "intelligence community oversight", we'd automatically search for:
- "inspector general report"
- "whistleblower complaint"
- "oversight hearing"
- "classified information"
- Related agencies, programs, legislation

---

## 2. Retrieve Information

### 2.1 Sources Where Information Exists (General Monitoring)

#### What I've Already Built âœ…

**Government Databases** (Integrated & Working):
- âœ… **SAM.gov** - Federal contracts (who's getting money, for what)

---

### 2.2 Automate Retrieval

#### What I've Built âœ…

**Daily Automated Monitoring**:
- âœ… Runs every morning at 6:00 AM automatically
- âœ… Searches all 8 databases in parallel (fast - ~30-60 seconds for 192 searches)
- âœ… Deduplicates results (doesn't send you the same article twice)
- âœ… Tracks what's new since yesterday
- âœ… AI filters for relevance (prevents false positives)
- âœ… Emails you an HTML digest with links to everything new

**Smart Search System**:
- âœ… Supports Boolean queries ("FISA AND surveillance", "Section 702")
- âœ… Handles quoted phrases ("Joint Special Operations Command")
- âœ… Tracks which keyword found each result

**Deep Research Engine** (New! Just Built):
- âœ… For complex investigative questions, breaks them into sub-questions automatically
- âœ… Example: "What is the relationship between JSOC and CIA Title 50 operations?"
  - AI breaks this into 5 research tasks
  - Searches each task
  - Discovers entities and their relationships
  - Creates follow-up tasks based on what it finds
  - Can run for hours if needed (configurable)
  - Generates comprehensive research report

**Web Interface** (Streamlit UI):
- âœ… **Quick Search**: Fast parallel search across all databases
- âœ… **Deep Research**: Multi-hour investigative research with task decomposition
- âœ… **Monitor Management**: Create/edit monitoring topics
- âœ… **Advanced Search**: Search individual databases with custom filters

---

#### What I Can Add ðŸ”¨

**Scheduled Scraping**:
- Daily/weekly scrapes of specific websites, blogs, agency pages
- RSS feed monitoring for news sites, government announcements
- Wayback Machine monitoring (detect when pages get deleted/changed)

**Agentic Research** (Already Built, Can Enhance):
- Current: Breaks complex questions into research tasks, investigates autonomously
- Can add: Multi-agent collaboration (different AIs specialize in different sources)
- Can add: Memory systems (builds knowledge graph over time)

**Automated Email Alerts**:
- Already working! You get daily digests automatically
- Can customize: Alert immediately for high-priority topics vs daily digest for routine monitoring

**Automated FOIA Requests**:
- Draft FOIA requests automatically based on your topics
- Submit to agency FOIA portals (some support email/web submission)
- Track request status
- Alert when responsive documents released

**Source Identification & Outreach**:
- Scan government job postings, contracts, court filings for potential sources
- Extract contact information (names, titles, agencies)
- Draft initial outreach emails for your review/approval
- Track follow-ups

**Example**: Contract posted for "surveillance technology integration" â†’ System finds company, identifies project manager from LinkedIn, drafts email asking about the contract's purpose.

---

## 3. Aggregate and Analysis - What Yields New Insights

### What I've Built âœ…

**Entity Extraction & Relationship Tracking**:
- âœ… AI automatically identifies people, organizations, programs, locations in search results
- âœ… Tracks how entities connect across different sources
- âœ… Example: Discovers that "JSOC" appears in contracts, job postings, and military press releases â†’ connects them
- âœ… Visualizes entity networks (shows you who/what is connected to what)

**Adaptive Search** (Multi-Phase Investigation):
- âœ… Phase 1: Broad initial search
- âœ… Phase 2: AI analyzes results, extracts important entities, searches them specifically
- âœ… Phase 3: Refines based on what Phase 2 found
- âœ… Continues until quality threshold reached or time limit
- âœ… Example: Search "military training exercises" â†’ finds "165th Airlift Wing" â†’ automatically searches for that unit specifically â†’ finds their specific operations

**Smart Filtering**:
- âœ… AI scores every result 0-10 for relevance to your investigative interests
- âœ… Only sends you results â‰¥6/10 (prevents wasting your time)
- âœ… Learns from your topics: knows that "Star Spangled Sailabration" isn't relevant to domestic extremism monitoring even though it contains "NVE"

**Pattern Detection** (Can Build):
- Detect patterns across time (e.g., "surveillance contracts increase 300% after specific legislation passes")
- Connect dots between seemingly unrelated sources
- Identify unusual spending patterns, agency activity, personnel movements

---

### What I Can Add ðŸ”¨

**Timeline Generation**:
- Automatically create timelines from scattered information
- Example: Track how a program evolved from initial concept â†’ funding â†’ contracting â†’ implementation

**Network Analysis**:
- Map connections between contractors, agencies, officials
- Identify who works where, who gets which contracts, who oversees what

**Anomaly Detection**:
- Flag unusual patterns: sudden contract awards, unusual job postings, deleted pages
- Alert when something deviates from normal patterns

**Cross-Source Correlation**:
- Connect information across databases automatically
- Example: Job posting for "signals intelligence analyst" + contract for "SIGINT platform" + Congressional testimony about surveillance â†’ all related, system connects them

**Document Analysis**:
- Once we integrate document databases (WikiLeaks, FOIA Vault, etc.):
  - Extract key information from PDFs automatically
  - Summarize long documents
  - Identify redactions, compare versions
  - Extract structured data (names, dates, programs)

---

## 4. Write Up the Information

### What I've Built âœ…

**Automated Summaries**:
- âœ… Daily digest emails with AI-generated summaries of what's new
- âœ… Deep research reports: Comprehensive markdown reports with:
  - Executive summary
  - Key findings (bullet points)
  - Detailed analysis (paragraphs connecting information)
  - Entity network explanation
  - Sources cited

**Example Deep Research Report Output**:
```
# Research Report: Relationship Between JSOC and CIA Title 50 Operations

## Executive Summary
JSOC operates under Title 10 (military authority) while CIA conducts covert
action under Title 50 (intelligence authority). In practice, they frequently
collaborate through liaison structures, with operational control shifting
based on policy decisions about attribution and oversight requirements...

## Key Findings
- Legal distinction: Title 10 vs Title 50 determines command chains and
  congressional oversight
- Operational overlap: Both conduct counterterrorism, but under different
  authorities
- Cross-authority arrangements common: Personnel can shift between Title 10
  and 50 operations
...

[Continues with detailed analysis, entity relationships, sources]
