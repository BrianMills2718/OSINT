The CIA denied\n it.  And President  Reagan also denied government      involvement, but\n he  admitted  the White House did know about private American help\n to the Contras.\n PRESIDENT  REAGAN:    We've  been  aware   that  there  are\n private  groups and private  citizens  that  have  been trying to help\n the  Contras,  to  that  extent.    But  we  did not   know  the  exact\n particulars of what they're doing.\n COLLINGS:    Some critics  on  Capitol  Hill thought    the\n Administration knew    a  lot  more than that.\n SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY:  The Administration  is skating   on\n the knife-edge of credibility.\n COLLINGS:    I'm Anthony Collings  in Washington.   Welcome\n to Newsmaker Saturday.\n Credibility  is    once again  an  issue.   Critics  find it\n hard to believe when     the   Administration says  the Iceland meeting\n OFFICES IN: WASAHIfMroved T.C For i RNEIeiVI -a YORK ?\n LOS ANGELES ? CHICAGO ?

Wasn't  there a disinformation campaign?\n SENATOR  WILLIAM              COHEN:    Well,  first  let me  be very\n clear.   The committee itself did not make an investigation.            The\n Chairman  of the Intelligence Committee,         Dave Durenberger,  and the\n chief of staff,  Bernie McMahon,          made an inquiry.   And        they were\n satisfied  there         had been  no,    quote,   official    campaign for\n disinformation.  Which   is  not   the    same   as saying       that stories did\n not   leak  into the   press  or  were  not         deliberately leaked  by\n certain     individuals that  may         have  planted  false  stories  or\n misleading stories.      But     there    was   no evidence,  according  to\n their inquiry, of an  official campaign          orchestrated and organized\n by     the White House.\n COLLINGS:   But  the White House spokesman,  Larry     Speakes,\n used the word \"authoritative,\" referring  to  the         story,         as  if  it\n were deliberate and     intentional,      not just...\n SENATOR COHEN:   I     think  there  were  individuals   within\n the  State Department,       perhaps  in  other  facets of the White House\n operation,  of  individuals   who indeed  did believe    it  was  important\n to     try  and  disseminate  information       that might  keep   Qaddafi,\n quote, off  balance.    I    think  that  they  now recognize  the  dangers\n in  using,  in any way,      the U.S.  media to convey   information which\n is patently      false.\n COLLINGS:   Admiral Turner,  do you agree that  there is        a\n danger  in  this, or  do you  feel  that  it's  a  good  thing?\n ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD        TURNER:    Oh, I think disinformation\n can be used quite to  our  advantage  and  it's       a  good  thing  to    do\n from  time  to  time.    But  on  the     one   extreme, you  can      have  a\n disinformation program that    disinforms  only  one      person.       And  I\n could cite  an  actual   case        that  I participated in   where     we did\n that  very  effectively  for  our country.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:  Can you cite that case?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Yes. We tried to get  the ambassador   of\n a foreign country,     who was democratically inclined,  to go back to\n his  country  and  engage  in  a  dispute  that  was  going  on  in  the\n government  about  whether it  should be  moved to the  left.    And  we\n disinformed  this  ambassador  about  his        own  status in  his own\n country,    and he went home to take care of his      own problem, and we\n got  him    into the  fray  in fighting for the   democratic side.   It\n was a very useful thing.   Didn't happen     to win,  but        nonetheless\n we  disinformed him    and  he did  do what we wanted him  to do.\n COLLINGS:  Are you saying you lied?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: Yes,  we lied    to him   and we made this\n man believe something was going  on that    affected him  in     his home\n country     that  was  not  going  on.   But we  got  him  back  into the\n fray,  so to speak.\n On  the  other  extreme,     you can  disinform  the  whole\n American      public,  or   the  whole  world,  practically.      And in\n thiscase,  the Administration      was  insensitive to the       degree which\n they   were    moving away  from  a   single disinformation  to  a  very\n broad  disinformation.\n COLLINGS:   Arnaud de Borchgrave,    the Soviet Union has a\n campaign of disinformation,      as we  know.         Aren't  we stooping to\n their  level when we    do the  same  thing?\n ARNAUD  DE   BORCHGRAVE:   Well,  first,  I       have to make a\n correction       about the  Wall  Street     Journal  story.     It was\n authoritative.       As  a  matter of   fact,   what  was happening  in\n Tripoli at that      time was a meeting with President Assad of Syria;\n Ghebril     (?),  a  well-known  Palestinian  terrorist;         Abu Moussa,\n another well-known Palestinian terrorist; the head        of the Iranian\n Revolutionary  Guards.      And French counterintelligence  happens  to\n know  that     they  were  at that very moment plotting some terrorist\n actions in Western Europe.\n COLLINGS:      But we  know that  Poindexter  talked  about\n Qaddafi being quiescent.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He was not  quiescent.   There was...\n COLLINGS:      Whatever reports there  were,  they  weren't\n clear that he was planning new terrorism.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Because we  in  the  media  were  not doing\n our  job.   They  put  out   a statement,  the Libyan news  agency -- I\n don't  know  why  we didn't pick  it  up.  They   said,  \"We  are setting\n up     special  revolutionary --  secret   revolutionary cells  in many\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n Western     countries  in  order to launch attacks against America          in\n such  a  way   that they  will  not  be  able  to  retaliate  with       their\n aircrft     carriers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"            This\n was a direct quote     from the Libyan news agency.\n He  was  not  quiescent.   But  again,  that's conventional\n wisdom right  away,   he was quiescent.\n As  for  the  Soviet Union,  you know that  they spend three\n to   four   bil-l,ion  d ollars  a  year an  active  measures,           which\n encompasses all    forms  of disinformation.   We have printed as         fact\n in  our media countless Soviet      forgeries. And  I could              spend  the\n next two hours reciting them from memory.\n COLLINGS:  Well,  don't  do that,  because we want  to talk\n about American disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   We    don't  get  involved in that.   We do\n not  plant  disinformation  in our  own    media.   As the Admiral       said,\n abroad  there are some disinformation       operations that go on.         But\n let's make quite clear that there is a major  difference               between\n strategic deception,  which we were involved in against Qaddafi to\n destabilize him,      psych him,  psychological  warfare;        and       all that\n was  indeed           going  on, and for  a  very  good reason.   He considers\n himself to be  in a permanent state      of war with the United States.\n COLLINGS:   Strategic deception.     Lying,  in    uther words.\n Do you approve?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:       Strategic        deception  in   a  military\n COLLINGS:    Do you approve?\n SENATOR  COHEN:     I  think we  have  to draw  a distinction\n once    again.    It's  one  thing  to have  ships   steaming  toward      the\n coast  of  Libya.      That  is a fact  if we are doing it.   It's quite\n another to,               I think, publish reports, feed reports  to  American\n journalists   and  suggest      that  there  is  a coup  in      the    making  to\n ovrethrow Qaddafi,     that he  is  internally         unstable,  that we  are\n giving     aid  and comfort,    as  such,  to those       forces  who wish  to\n overthrow      him,    when in  fact   the   situation   might              be quite\n different.\n As  far     as  Qaddafi himself, it's perhaps a bad example.\n But nonetheless what     it does    is  it throws that seed  of      disbelief\n or  lack    of  credibility     out there so that we are never believed.\n If in fact we have...\n COLLINGS:    We have to take a break at  this point,  and we\n will be right back.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:      On   Newsmaker   Saturday,   our   topic   is\n disinformation  and  credibility.\n Admiral   Turner,   in World War II the United States lied\n about  the location  of  the   invasion  at  Normandy  in order  to save\n lives   of American soldiers.   That was wartime.   We're not   at war\n now,  and yet we are still     lying.   Why  is that?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:      There     are  some times,  even   in\n peacetime,  when you do lie.   A     friend  of mine,  for instance,  was\n asked  by  a newspaperman  the      day  that the  Iranian rescue operation\n was  actually  taking  place,  \"Is  there  not  a      rescue   operation\n taking place?\"    And my friend,   very  appropriately, said,  \"No.\"\n He  called  the     newsman  the next   day and          said, \"I\n apologize.          I deliberately lied to you.   But there were lives at\n stake yesterday,  and so I could not even waffle my    answer to you.\n I  had  to be categoric in  saying no.\"\n COLLINGS:   So when lives are at       stake,  it's  all  right.\n Are  there any  other  conditions  when  it's all  right?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   We  think  of ourselves as being at, peace\n and we think       of peace treaties and armistices and truces       and war\n and  declarations  of  war.        Some our  adversaries  in   this  day  and\n age  don't think that  way.    They  consider     themselves  to be  in     a\n permanent  state  of war  with  Western  democracies,  albeit  conducted\n through  indirect  means,   whether it's subversion  or  penetration       or\n disinformation or state-sponsored terrorism.\n COLLINGS: But that's what      they consider.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Yes.\n COLLINGS:   Why    should we   think  the  same way  they  do?\n Why  should we behave the same  way  they  do?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   If  people consider      themselves to be at\n war  against  the  citadel  of  capitalism  --  namely,  the  United\n States --  as  they  call  it,  well,    then, obviously we  have to\n react.       And you're not going to be conducting   this according to\n the Marquis   of Queensberry's  rules,   are you?\n COLLINGS:   Senator Cohen,  do you think we should use the\n same means  that  they do?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,  I  think  one  of the difficulties\n with making  such    a  broad  statement is  that    if  you  adopt. the\n policies  that the Libyans  or  the Soviets  or  any  other  countries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n who  have  declared  war,   active  or  covert,   or  terroristic     or\n conventional, against  the United  States,  it    seems  to me  if that's\n the general proposition,     then you can always say  it's    open for us\n to deceive the  enemy.   And  the  question is,   how  does  one  go about\n deceiving the enemy?\n It seems to me that if  we adopt  that  as     a general\n policy,   that it's all right  to put  deceptive measures         into the\n media  to convey  that  to keep the enemy guessing,  then we have a\n question  of  when  do the  American   people     really  believe   that\n the  President or  the  White  House    or  the   Congress is     actually\n telling them the truth.     Right now...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      That's   our     job,   Senator.     As\n journalists,  we  can't        be  spoon-fed.     When  we  say       in   our\n profession,   \"We've  been   lied     to,\"   that is     sanctimonious,\n hypocritical  nonsense.      What  government     has  not  lied?   What\n government  has not misled  or     tried  to mislead the press?\n So, what are we? Are  we  journalists,     or  are we  just\n conveyor belts for government    information?\n SENATOR COHEN:        That assumes that the government         is in  a\n state  of  constantly lying to the press.   I don't believe that      to\n be  the case.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No,  it  isn't.   But  we can see through\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:       And that's what was so foolish          in this\n case.  Because the day  after the Wall Street Journal printed that\n story, Leslie Gelb  of the New York      Times just decimated it      in his\n paper because it was a bad story.   And the Administration        should\n have   recognized that  planting  something  like  that  in the U.S.\n media  was  bound  to blow  up  in  their  face,  as  it  did.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    They did not plant it  in the U.S.  media.\n That has been determined. There was nothing planted  in the         U.S.\n media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER: That      certainly  is      not  true.   That's\n just an assertion by...\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No.   No,  not  at  all.   You can check it\n out.   And in fact,  the Intelligence Committee has checked it      out.\n There  was  a  memo  floating  around,  a  memo  floating around --    I\n think  the  Senator  can  confirm      this. No  disinformation      was\n planted in the U.S.  media.\n ADMIRAL      TURNER:   Oh, that's certainly untrue.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   At that time?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   That's  certainly untrue.   Now,  it may\n not  have     been  authorized by the  President of  the  United  States,\n but  disinformation  was  planted by  somebody  in   the  Administration.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Even the Wall   Street  Journal  will    tell\n you  that     they  were not victims  of disinformation.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,   they're  trying  to cover  their\n number,  too.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  No.       Because there were two things that\n were  correct  there, Admiral,  and   we  just    discussed  them  at  the\n top  of the program.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   You  have heard  they   are correct.   I\n don't   agree with     what  you said.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  You're not part      of the Administration.\n Here's someone who's on the Intelligence Committee.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   He's  not part  of the Administration.\n He's  in the Congress.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He's  done  his homework.   And Bernie Kalb\n resigned   on the  strength      of    Bob  Woodward's  piece   in    the\n Washington    Post, not   on     the   strength  of  anything  else    he\n discovered.\n COLLINGS:     All  right, but  he  did resign.    And   that\n implies  that  he    felt that the Administration had  lied  and had,  in\n fact,  gotten caught    lying.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: He     took  Bob  Woodward's    piece at  face\n value.    And  even   Bob   Woodward  corrected           his piece three days\n later.\n SENATOR COHEN:   The nature  of the problem is,  as we're\n seeing now with            the alleged involvement in Nicaragua of the CIA,\n if  you  took  a poll  on the streets  of America,      I  suppose that the\n majority       would come  back  and  say, \"We don't  believe  the  denial.\"\n And  that  is  the  difficulty  that one  has  once   you  are  perceived to\n have been deceiving    or planting stories   or not  leveling with    the\n American       people. It      tends  to undermine everything, even when\n you're right.      That's sort  of    the road  you  walk  down. Once you\n take  a   lie  and   give    it  the  perfume  of  truth,  ultimately what\n happens    is  truth  has  the  perfume   of  lies.    And  no matter how\n truthful       your  statement  might  be,     it is perceived  to  be  a\n falsehood.     And that's  the  danger  we   run.\n So,  we've  got   to have  those c                t     hick we\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07: CIA-RD gf 8g 01  666900~8d(fi%-\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n in fact\n o\n t  i\n do\n engage in disinformation be very,  very clearly  spelled\n u\n n\n oli\n our\n own minds as to when it's justified.   But as a general\n p\n cy,\n we\n lose,  ultimately,  when  we  are        perceived  to  have\n engaged\n or\n pursue a policy  of engaging in disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    But  haven't  all  Administrations  had\n credibility gaps,  Senator?\n SENATOR COHEN:     Oh,  of       course.     That's  a constant\n problem with the Congress,   as well: Do we have a credibility gap\n between  what we  say  and  what we  do?\n COLLINGS: How does     this  Administration  compare with\n others in terms     of credibility gap?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:      I  am  yet to meet  a  public official,\n whether it's here  or abroad,    who doesn't speak with three voices:\n the      on-the-record voice,    beyond-the-record  voice,    and the\n background voice.  And sometimes they're 180 degrees apart.\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:  But  if  you  look   at  the  record, this\n Administration's credibility has been challenged much more often.\n I  look  on   it  from a rather  parochial  point     of view\n because I worry about      another wave of public lack  of confidence\n in  the  CIA.   And these  two  events,  the  shooting  down of the\n airplane in Nicaragua and the   disinformation  against   Libya are\n reviving that  again,  just  as  we  had  with  the     mining of the\n harbors  in Nicaragua and   the manual  of   assassination  and the\n assassination   effort     against  a man named Fadlallah in Beirut.\n All of these...\n COLLINGS:   Well, what do you think  is the extent  of CIA\n involvement in Nicaragua?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:    Well,  I think  there's  very  little\n question that the CIA  is providing help and support  and advice to\n these people who are  freebooters and are doing things down there.\n They're doing it       on the verge of the law.   I don't think they're\n doing anything technically  illegal.\n COLLINGS:     But   when   they       deny  it, then   it's   a\n credibility  problem.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   They're perfectly proper in denying it.\n But  their credibility  is  bad  because  they're   working     on   the\n wording of the  law,  not  on the  spirit  and  the  intent  of  the  law.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Have  you       noticed,  Admiral,    how  when\n somebody goes   down  and fights against  the communists in a Third\n World country he becomes a vulgar mercenary,  and if someone is\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n fighting     on  the  communists's  side  he  is  treated  with awesome\n veneration?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   I  certainly don't  have any veneration\n for the Sandinistas.   I don't know what      you're talking about.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No, but an American was killed  fighting\n with  the  Sandinistas   a     couple of  years  ago,   and  it  made        a\n paragraph    or  two in  the  papers  and  he was called  an  idealist.\n COLLINGS:   Well, we'll take a break  at  this      point,    and\n then we'll be  right back?\n COLLINGS:     We're   talking   about   truth,        lies   and,\n credibility....\n Admiral  Turner, how     much long-term      damage     is  being\n caused  to  the  CIA    and   to  the  Administration     by  the  kind     of\n credibility gap you've been talking about?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: I think  it's considerable because    it's\n happened     over  a considerable period of time.         We must remember,\n Tony,  that the  most  fundamental     strength  of       our country  is  a\n well-informed      electorate,    well-informed citizens. I think the\n citizens     have been  not  well  informed  in  these   cases  and      the\n citizens     are  going  to question  what  the government says  in the\n future.      And  that will  be  very injurious     to  our  democratic\n process.\n COLLINGS:   And yet   you yourself say that  disinformation\n COLLINGS:    How can you have it both ways?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Because you don't want  to disinform the\n American     public.     The instance I  cited  to  you, the   American\n public      never  knew  about   it, because  it  was a  very   limited\n disinformation program.   You    have  to take  some  risks        once  in  a\n while.      Disinforming  one  person  is  an extreme case.   Sometimes\n you disinform a larger group.   When you do it      overseas,     which you\n really  should --  you    never should do it  in the United States --\n you are risking  that  it  will                  come  back    into  the  United  States\n media  because we  really  have  one world    media.  So,        again,    you\n have to be very careful about     it.\n Much  of  the disinformation the United States  needs to\n put  out really   isn't disinformation. It's getting into other\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n countries true information by  surreptitious means,  often,     because\n it  won't get  in any  other way.\n COLLINGS:    We'll put that  aside  and  just         talk  about\n disinformation.\n Senator?\n SENATOR  COHEN:  Just  to  correct  a point.   Number one,\n the  CIA     was not  involved  in  a  disinformation    campaign,  for\n openers.   They  are  not  involved.\n Number two, I think that the CIA has enjoyed an increase\n in its stature in     the  past  four  or  five  years.  Certainly  the\n morale  is  much  higher  than  it  has    been in recent years.    And I\n think that  the  public   has taken a  different  attitude  toward  the\n CIA,  in     view  of  the kind  of circumstances we  find ourselves in\n globally.\n Number three, the   lack  of credibility,  I think, starts\n from the top-down.    A point  you made  in your opening  statement.\n It  seems    to me incomprehensible  as  to why  the    Administration\n would say    no deal has  been made with respect  to Mr.  Daniloff.   A\n deal  clearly was  made,  a  bargain    was  struck,  and they ought to\n say so.      Everybody else knows that.   And for the Administration,\n the President to say,        \"No trade,\" it  simply   starts taking the\n shine off the credibility.   And that     tends to filter down.\n But       as  far  as the CIA  is concerned, we have known for\n several years the Administration does want to maintain a vigorous\n campaign of support          for the Contras. The CIA will  in  fact play a\n role  in that  support.      Both  Houses of Congress have   voted  for\n such   a   measure.         It's waiting  for conference  action at this\n point.\n So,  I would say  it's somewhat misleading to suggest that\n the CIA now has a lack  of credibility.      It's  something  that  may\n affect     all of government, to the extent that we don't    level vith\n people on items  that  are   clearly          within  the  public domain and\n which common sense tells     them...\n COLLINGS:    Let  me  ask  you  this.   Your  committee  has\n oversight  responsibility    for  the   intelligence  community.    How\n much  attention  do you  devote to the question of disinformation,\n to make sure that there's no violation  of            the  guidelines on not\n misleading the American public?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   We  maintain a          very  vigorous oversight\n program.   I     think  that's why  we're  satisfied  the  CIA  was  not\n involved   in    any disinformation  campaign.    To  the  extent there\n were  individuals  within    the  White  House         or  within  the State\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release-2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901R000600400018-2\n Department    who  may   have  briefed  a          reporter  and  gave  him\n misinformation or disinformation,  that         should  not  be attributed\n to the        CIA.   This  was specifically n  of  a CIA program.   The CIA\n is looked at  very closely by us.\n COLLINGS:    Admiral,  you were about to make a point.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:      Well,  I was  going  to say  that it  is\n illegal,  I  believe,  Senator,  today        for  the  CIA  to support the\n Contras.\n SENATOR COHEN:    That's correct.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Other than with  intelligence  support.\n SENATOR COHEN:     Other than with communications...\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Communications and intelligence.   So if\n they had any  role in the airplane incident,  it was  an illegality.\n It may not be illegal tomorrow,  if the Congress  passes  this  new\n law,  but it has been illegal up till now,        was illegal  if they did\n something yesterday.\n I  think  the  genesis  of  the whole Wall Street  [Journal]\n disinformation problem was a misinterpretation  by  the  CIA  of an\n intelligence         report  that     said Qaddafi was on the verge of being\n able to be toppled.    I       think  they  fell  for that one when   they\n shouldn't have because they wanted to believe that.\n SENATOR COHEN:   Can I  kind of just   contradict that for a\n moment?       The       CIA  was never misled  by  any report  that  said Qaddafi\n was  on the verge of being toppled.         From all the information that\n I  saw,  that clearly  was  not    the  case.   That information, wherever\n it came,  did not      come  from intelligence sources.\n COLLINGS: Let me ask you about...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   The Admiral made a point  about       credibi-\n lity  and                       said  that it's     very important  that  we  not  question our\n government,  that     we believe   our government.   I hope  that  in  this\n profession,        Admiral,  we  never  stop      questioning our government.\n That's   part            of the democratic process.   Always  question your\n government.   That's what makes  it  a healthy society.\n COLLINGS:        But   the  government   has     to   take into\n consideratin  the  fact  that  it's being questioned by       the press.\n But  it has certain objectives,            which  include  goals that  can be\n achieved by   lying,     in effect.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Every     Administration,  Tony,       tries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n every Administration,  Tony,  tries to manage the news...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   ...and  put  the  best  face  possible  on\n what  they're  doing.   And  our  job  in  the media is to try to see\n through    it.\n COLLINGS: Let me  ask  you about the Soviets.   How much\n mileage do you  think they will get   out  of the problems that    have\n cropped up  recently with Administration credibility,  on Libya,     on\n Nicaragua, on other matters?\n SENATOR   COHEN:   Well, in a recent item that  appeared in\n the      newspaper,   the   Soviet Union       jumped   upon Secretary\n Weinberger's  statement     that  the Soviets,  to the extent that they\n pulled any troops     out  of Afghanistan,  will only replace them with\n fresh  troops. The Soviet paper clearly jumped on that      and said,\n \"We are surprised and shocked that a high       official  would  engage\n in such,    quote,  a falsehood.\"\n COLLINGS:   We have only  a few seconds  left.\n Admiral   Turner,    what's   your   view   on   the Soviet\n exploitation of this credibility problem?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I think they  will  do everything\n they  can  to  exploit  it.   I'm not  sure  it  will get   them a lot of\n mileage,    truly.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    Our   problem  is  that   we're choirboys\n trying to deal with Jack the Ripper.\n COLLINGS: Okay.

November 1984 \nA Letter to the Editor of the New York Tribune \nSirs: \nLev Navrozov, in his articles published in the August 23rd \nand October 1, 1984 issues of the New York Tribune, made a \nnumber of malicious attacks and insinuations against me and my \nrecent book, \"New Lies For Old.\" In his articles, he questions' \nthe historic evidence which I produced and also my access to \nthe KGB and its secrets. He stated that this evidence consti-\ntuted my personal inventions and fantasies. I wish to assure \nyou and your readers that my knowledge about the Central \nCommittee's and KGB's preparations for the adoption of the new \nlong range policy and the active role of the KGB in it, was \navailable to me because I had witnessed these preparations while \nI was both a student at the KGB Institute and a senior officer \nof Soviet Intelligence at KGB Headquarters in Moscow. During \nthe period 1957 - 1959, the KGB Institute was directed, by the \nCentral Committee, to prepare numerous studies regarding the \nuse of intelligence and security assets for inclusion in the \nstrategies against the West. These studies were made available \nto the Institute students and were discussed at the conferences \nof the Institute. At that time, I read the secret report of \nShelepin regarding the new political tasks of the KGB. The KGB \nInstitute played a major role in the re-assessment of Stalin's \npolitical practices and the shift to a Leninist approach. While \nat KGB Headquarters during 1959 and 1960, I personally witnessed \nthe KGB reorganization, its political reorientation, its practical \npreparation for strategic disinformation and its active role in \nthe realization of the new strategies. During this same period, \novert political consultations between party leaders occurred as \nwell as many secret consultations between KGB officials and \nsecurity chiefs of the bloc countries. I personally witnessed \nthe formation of the Disinformation Department and monitored \nits beginning. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-2-\nGiven this evidence, the substance of my book is not \ngroundless fantasy as intimated by Mr. Navrozov, but instead \nan expose and a realistic description of the Communise' \nStrategic Disinformation Program in action. This program, \nwhich was launched in 1958, has seriously damaged Western \ninterests and greatly benefitted our Communist adversaries. \nIt has further generated a great deal of confusion regarding \nCommunist developments in the minds of Western analysts and how \nto deal with them. It has created a crisis in the West which \nis being successfully exploited by the Communist strategists. \nMr. Navrozov has misinformed your readers by stating that my \n'book is Soviet agitprop, i.e., propaganda. My book is con-\ncerned with Communist strategies and strategic disinformation, \nand is definitely not about propaganda. The book demonstrates \nthat the Communists are presently determined to win the political \nstruggle with the West, utilizing their strategies and strategic \ndisinformation and not through Communist propaganda. Their \nstrategic disinformation program has helped them in the success-\nful realization of some of the Communist strategies and has \ncreated a critical situation because the West, albeit unwittingly, \nhas helped in the realization of the Communist strategies. For \nexample, it was Communist strategic disinformation which in the \n1960's was responsible for the unilateral United States reduc-\ntion in arms which resulted in the Soviet military superiority \nand the decline of the U.S. from its military superiority posi-\ntion. \nI would like to point out yet other gross inaccuracies made \nby Mr. Navrozov in his articles. He equates Stalin and Shelepin \npractices in the use of Communist priests, writers and scientists. \nHowever, the practices cannot be equated. Stalin, as it is well \nknown, imprisoned, exiled or shot scientists, writers and priests \nwho failed to do his bidding, as evidenced by the death sentences \nfor twenty Jewish writers during the period 1948 - 1952. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-3-\nShelepin, in contrast, resorted to an active use of scientists, \nwriters and priests in the Strategic Disinformation Program. \nIt is in this context that one should examine the actiVist role \nof the academician SAKHAROV or the writer TWARDOUSKIY. Such an \nexamination would explain why the omnipotent KGB tolerated the \nactivist role of SAKHAROV up until 1980 and his long and unin-\nterrupted contacts with prominent Western correspondents in \nMoscow, and why the KGB overlooked the mailing of letters and \nmanuscripts by SAKHAROV to persons in the United States since \n1968 and again recently from his place of exile. What was the \npurpose of injecting the letters of SAKHAROV in the American \ndebate on the arms race and what effect did they have on the \ndebate? An effective examination of SAKHAROV's pronouncements \ncan be made only in terms of the Soviet military strategy, the \nSALT negotiations and strategic disinformation. It may be that \nsuch an examination would reveal that his pronouncements were \nactually designed by the Communist strategists to influence \nAmerican policies, the SALT negotiations and the arms race debate. \nOne should also ask the question whether SAKHAROV's pronouncements \ncontributed to the emergence of the nuclear freeze. debate in the \nUnited States. SAKHAROV, in his 1968 treatise, predicted that \nthere would be an attack against the U.S. militarism at the \nbeginning of the 1980's. I can understand why SAKHAROV was \ncorrect. Such an attack on U.S. militarism was attempted in \nrecent times in Western Europe. \nAnother example of Mr. Navrozov's complete disregard for \nthe facts can be cited. In my book, \"New Lies For Old,\" I \ndescribed how the KGB, under Shelepin, drawing on its experience \nin successfully manipulating its controlled political opposition \nagainst the West, as in the well known operation \"Trust\", decided \nto again use the KGB controlled opposition in the framework of \ntheir long range strategy. Such KGB designs provide an oppor-\ntunity to analyze the dissident movement in the U.S.S.R. as a \nnew \"Trust\". Mr. Navrozov tries to defend the dissident move-\nment, completely ignoring past experiences and the new KGB design \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \nto manipulate the political opposition. I find this kind of \nattitude in a dissident as rather strange. Further, his boast-\nful references in his articles concerning Soviet defectse spend-\ning and his \nin the last \nMy response \ndenigration of my views on Soviet military efforts \ntwenty years can only be characterized as ridiculous. \nto all of his criticisms is that \"he does not know \nwhat he is talking about.\" In the 1960's, I warned the proper . \nauthorities that the U.S.S.R. was going to try to achieve mili-\ntary superiority, and also warned about the dangers of detente \nand the provision of U.S. credit and technology to the Communist \ncountries. My warnings were meaningful because they were given \nahead of time. Mr. Navrozov's articles, however, are all mean-\ningless since they were given postfactum when the United States \nhad already made erroneous decisions which led to the loss of \ntheir military superiority. \nMr. Navrozov's attacks on Mr. Angleton, Mr. Hackett, Mr. \nArnaud de Borchgrave, Mr. Robert Moss, the British S.I.S., this \nauthor and many other experts on disinformation are not only \nirresponsible, but rather pretentious. I characterize this \noverall attack as grossly irresponsible because 'such persons as \nMessrs. Angleton, de Borchgrave and Moss have raised and brought \nconcern for the Communist disinformation issue and its impact \non the United States to the attention of the nation and to the \nWestern world. I find Mr. Navrozov's assertion that my book is \nuseful to the KGB, as most shocking and malicious. I am firmly \nconvinced that my book is the only realistic and timely presenta-\ntion which not only exposes the success of the Communist Strate-\ngic Disinformation Program, but also permits one to view the \nCommunist strategies in a new light. Further, the exposure in \nthe book creates serious obstacles for further Communist \nstrategic successes. My book has caught the Communist strate-\ngists, the KGB and their secret helpers red handed in mid stream \nof their preparation for a new strategic offensive in Europe. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-5-\nI would like to make a summation of my impressions re-\ngarding Mr. Navrozov's articles. First, I seriously doubt that \nhe has an in-depth knowledge about the KGB, and whether he is \nat all qualified when he categorically dismisses the potential \nof the Bloc Intelligence System, and particularly, the Strate-\ngic Disinformation Program as it is directed against the West. \nThese are not minor issues since they involve the surviva:1 of \nthe United States. I believe that Mr. Navrozov has the duty \nto inform the public what his qualifications are that make him \nan authority on the KGB and on strategic disinformation. His \narticles contain so many inaccuracies and a complete disregard \nfor factual reporting that it appears that he does not compre-\nhend the high responsibility that accompanies reporting in the \nWestern world. His style is reminiscent of that of a fanatical \nreporter of a Communist provincial newspaper during the Stalin \nyears. His insinuations and assertions indicate that he, him-\nself, is under the spell of \"Communist Disinformation,\" and \nthat he is utterly confused by it. I feel that it would be \nuseless to argue the issues with Mr. Navrozov since he is \nobviously hopelessly confused and has closed his mind to reason \nBased on this, it appears that Mr. Navrozov is not a solution, \nbut a part of the problem. \nI am, however, concerned about the confusion which his \narticles may have generated in your readers and thus, would \nlike to share with them some of my views on the interaction \nbetween Communist strategies and strategic _disinformation. In \nmy opinion, if one understands the Communist strategies, one \nwill have an opportunity to detect, to understand, and to \nanalyze conciftte strategic disinformation operations, and to \nsee how they serve the strategies. Let me dwell for a few \nmoments on these concrete strategies and try to explain them, \nnot in academic terms as I did in my book, but in simple prag-\nmatic terms. There cannot be strategic disinformation in \ngeneral. One must first grasp the concrete strategy and then \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n- 6-\ndetermine what specific disinformation activities serve and con-\ntribute to the success of the strategy. First, for example, \nthere is the long range Communist policy for developinrmature \nsocialist societies and for achieving world domination. This \npolicy includes the military strategy of achieving the Communist \nBloc's military superiority through political-diplomatic negotia-\ntions with the United States and through the receipt of Western \nmilitary technology by the U.S.S.R. in the first phase, and by \nChina in the second phase. If one grasps this strategy, one \ncan better understand how its ultimate success is served by the \ndisinformation regarding the Sino-Soviet split. Second, another \n\"Communist strategy is its economic strategy whereby they strive \nto develop their economic-technical foundation so that it is \nsuperior to that of the West. This is to be accomplished with \nthe help of Western technology and with Western credit. It does \nnot require much wisdom to see that the success of the second \nstrategy is well served by the \"Rumanian Independence Disinforma-\ntion\" and again by the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation. \nThird, the European strategy is aimed at breaking up the \nNATO alliance and at the withdrawal of the United States forces \nfrom Europe through the German reunification and European securi-\nty. Taking this strategy into account, one can realize how well \nit may be served by Ceasescu's Independence Disinformation, by \nHonneker's raprochment with Western Germany and by the coming \nintroduction of false liberalization and the use of controlled \nopposition in Eastern Europe and in the U.S.S.R. \nFourth, another Communistf4(thi d world strategy)is aimed at \nthe elimination of Western influence in this area and the achieve-\nment of a United Front with the developing countries through the \nsupport of Wars of Liberation, by active diplomacy and by the use \nof a variety of tactics on the part of individual Communist \nstates instead of one tactic of a Communist monolith. If one \ntakes this strategy into account, one can see that the Sino-Soviet \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n- 7-\nSpilt Disinformation, in fact the duality of actions, and par-\nticularly, the disinformation of Tito 's independence, served \nthis strategy quite well. The late Tito almost succeeded in \ntaking these countries away from the West through the so-called \n\"Non-Aligned Movement.\" \nA few words regarding the solution of the problem are \nrequired. Since Communist Strategic Disinformation Operations \nare a product of the Communist strategists, i.e., man made, the \nclinical analysis of their technology should be man made as well. \nIn my view, this is a major task for Western governments and \ntheir intelligence and counter-intelligence services. Without a \nsolution of this task, one cannot expect either an understanding \nof Communist strategic disinformation in the West or a viable \nWestern policy toward the Communist world. \nThe conduct of Communist strategic disinformation operations \nand the confusion it generates are great obstacles for the success-\nful functioning of genuine political opposition in the Communist \ncountries and abroad. I have come to the conclusiQn that unless \nthe political opposition to the Communist regimes realizes the \ntrue essence of strategic disinformation and its connection with \ntheir strategies, they will make grave mistakes since they may be \nexploited skillfully by the Communist strategists and they, un-\nwittingly, may even serve the Communist strategists in achieving \ntheir goals. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029"

A major \nthrust of this effort--often comprised of crude, blatantly \nemotional appeals--has been to portray the United States as a \npractitioner of terrorism and subversion and a violator of human \nrights. Moscow also works hard at fostering opposition to US \nmilitary bases and personnel overseas. The pace and scope of the \nUSSR's disinformation activities\ufffdwhich have produced some \nbenefits for Moscow\ufffdsuggest that the Soviets will continue to \n--ke advantage of opportunities, particularly in the Third World. \n(b)(3) \n(b)(3) \nThis memorandum was prepared by  Office of Global \nIssues.

The Soviets have continued their campaign of many \nyears that the United States is conspiring to destabilize foreign \ncountries, particularly in the Third World, by sponsoring coups, \nassassinating political leaders, and conducting a variety of \nother subversive activities. \no Shortly after the military coup in Fiji in May, Radio \nMoscow, TASS and Izvestia all began to play up rumors of \nUS involvement. On 18 May, for example, Radio Moscow \nreported a statement by the Soviet-controlled World Peace \nCouncil--which cited a leftist British newspaper--that \n\"former CIA Deputy Director\" Walters was in Fiji when the \nplot was being planned and that US citizens participated \nin the event. Moscow stepped up its disinformation \ncampaign on 1 June with a TASS story implicating the CIA \nand US Secret Service. This report was replayed the next \nday in Zimbabwe and on 3 June in Uruguay. \no Since the February 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime \nMinister Olof Palme, Moscow has made a concerted effort to \nimplicate the United States in his death. In addition to \nnumerous Soviet and Bloc press accounts alleging US \ncomplicity in Palme's murder, Moscow produced a television \ndocu-drama entitled \"Why Did They Kill 010 Palme?\" The \nfilm, shown this year in Sweden and the USSR, included \naccusations of CIA involvement in the shooting. \no The USSR also uses forgeries, rumors, anonymous mailings \nand other methods to conduct its disinformation campaign \nalleging CIA  plans to destabilize Third World  \ngovernments. \n(b)(1) \n(b)(3) \n  In addition, US Embassy \nindicates that the KGB: \nPlanted a rumor in the Congo this spring alleging \nthat Zairian President Mobutu intended to use the CIA \nto assassinate Congo President Sassou-Nguesso. \nCirculated last year in India, Pakistan, Peru, Guyana \nand several African countries an unattributed \npamphlet entitled \"CIA Insider\",  which named alleged \nCIA agents and officers.  (b)(3)  \nGI M 87-20122 \n(b)(3) \n2 (b)(3) \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f(1-11('11 \n--Approved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n3 LLISr.,44... \nHuman Rights Counteroffensive. Long sensitive to Western \ncriticism of its human rights record, Moscow has recently \nintensified its efforts to denigrate the performance of the West \non this issue. \no The Soviets this year issued a series of charges--based on \na book published by Novosti--claiming that the CIA \ninstigated the 1978 Jonestown massacre in order to prevent \n.cult members from emigrating to the Soviet Union. Since \nthe allegation was first publicized in the 30 January \nedition of Izvestia, it has been replayed in the pro-\nSoviet Indian press and in the Communist press of Uruguay \nand East Germany. Moreover, the Novosti book has been \nreviewed in the Finnish and Danish press, thereby adding \ncredibility to the story. \no The publicity given in Soviet Bloc media and in Soviet \ndisinformation outlets overseas, leads us to believe that \nMoscow is behind a recent campaign alleging US trafficking \nin Central American children for the purpose of using them \nin organ transplant operations. This campaign appears to \nhave considerable momentum: Since the beginning of the \nyear, these charges have appeared not only in Soviet, \nCuban, Nicaraguan and Yugoslav media, but also in the \npress of the Dominican Republic, France, Guatemala, \nHonduras and India. \no In an effort to exploit the apartheid issue, the USSR is \ncontinuing to push allegations--begun in the early 1980s--\nthat the United States and South Africa are conducting \nresearch on a so-called ethnic weapon--a biological weapon \ndesigned to kill people selectively on the basis of \nrace. Radio Moscow again charged in February, for \nexample, that the ethnic bor.' (3) \n(b) \ufffdluld kill blacks but \"leave  \nout the white race.\" \nTargeting the US Military. The Soviets also have an \naggressive disinformation program targeting the US military \npresence overseas. \no In our view, a central element of this effort is Moscow's \nworldwide campaign, begun in October 1985, charging that \nAIDS is the result of US biological warfare experiments. \nDuring the past several months the USSR has repeatedly \nused the AIDS story as a means of heightening opposition \nto US military bases, troops, and port access rights \naround the globe: \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f\"'Approved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \nJI-A0M,U\ufffd \nIn February, a Ukrainian paper claimed that the \nJapanese were panicking over the spread of AIDS by US \nservicemen in Japan and that restaurants, barber \nshops, and other businesses near US bases had barred \nAmericans from entering. \nWe suspect the Soviets were responsible for a forged \npress release surfaced in May in West Berlin in which \na city health official purportedly announced that the \nUS Army hospital there was overflowing with AIDS \nvictims. \no Moscow has also surfaced allegations that some existing US \nmilitary facilities will be used in the Strategic Defense \nInitiative (SDI) program and that the United States is \nattempting to acquire new bases in order to destabilize \nparticular regions: \n- In March the Indian press ran an article on Soviet. \ncharges--attempting to play upon regional sensitivity \nabout military use of Diego Garcia--that the United \nStates produced SDI components there. \n- Soviet radio charged in April that joint US-Zaire \nmilitary maneuvers reflected a US interest in using \nthe Kamina air force base \n(b)(3) thern Zaire to \ndestabilize the region. \nIn our view, several trends charcterize recent Soviet \ndisinformation activity. \no The Soviets are persistent. In pushing a given theme, \nSoviet disinformation specialists apparently believe that \nrepetition of even the most unbelievable stories pays off \nin the long run. Indeed, Soviet charges that AIDS was \ndeveloped at Fort Detrick have been replayed in the press \nof over 60 countries. In April these allegations appeared \nin the official Indian armed forces journal \"Sainik \nSamachar.\" \no The Soviets seize on opportunities quickly. Within three \ndays after the coup in Fiji, for example, Radio Moscow, \nIzvestia, and TASS all carried stories implying US \ninvolvement. \no Moscow targets much of its disinformation toward Third \nWorld audiences. During the past year, we have seen a \nconcerted Soviet effort--in part through forgeries and \ndisinformation--to intensify anti-US sentiment within the \nNonaligned Movement, whose criticism of the United States \nand backing of many Soviet positions Moscow believes is a \nmajor political asset. There is also evidence that the \nSoviets are working hard to exploit growing political and \n(b)(3) \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f--Approved for Release: 201'7109/1 3 C05798947 \nS \neconomic tensions in southern Africa, using forgeries as \ntheir primary vehicle. Through this mechanism, Moscow has \nalleged US coup plotting against several black African \nstates; US-South African cooperation; and US circumvention \nof the arms embargo against South Africa. \no Soviet disinformation is often crude. Despite glasnost at \nhome and an increasingly sophisticated use of propaganda \nand public diplomacy, much Soviet disinformation continues \nto be comprised of crude, blatantly emotional appeals. As \nevidenced by the AIDS and baby trafficking campaigns, \nMoscow is apparently convinced that this approach can be \neffective, particularly in the Third World. \no The level of activity appears to be increasing. While \ndifficult to gauge, the level of Soviet disinformation \nactivity appears to be on the rise, as evidenced by the \nnumber of known or suspected Soviet forgeries that have \npublicly surfaced in the past 18 months. Typically in the \npast we have seen about 10-15 of such forgeries each year, \nbut for the 1986-87 eriod we are seein a rate of Ahout  \n20 per year. (W(1) \n(b)(3) \nAlthough the impact of Soviet disinformation cannot be \nmeasured precisely, we believe Moscow has reaped some benefits. \no US officials have been forced to protest a barrage of \n.anti-US AIDS disinformation stories throughout the Third \nWorld. \no In India, where Moscow's most common theme alleges that \nthe United States is conspiring to destabilize the country \nby supporting the Sikh and other separatist movements, \nIndians overwhelmingly believe that Washington is the \nsingle largest promoter of international terrorism, \naccording to public opinion data from 1985. \no According to press reporting, the ousted prime minister of \nFiji said in a June interview in Washington that he had \n\"strong suspicions\" of US involvement in the coup and \ncalled for a Congressional inquiry. \no Moscow's anti-CIA program--particularly the lists of \nalleged CIA officers and agents--has intimidated and cast \nsuspicion on many people. For example, the US Embassy in \nKinshasa reports that an editor of a Zairean newspaper who \nwas a contact of USIS feared that the government's \nsecurity service would interrogate him afterhis name \nappeared on a list of CIA agents.

Action required:  None.  This memorandum, which reports on the\n outcome of the 25-27 June Conference on Contemporary Soviet Propaganda and\n Disinformation (CSPD), is for information only.\n Conference Results\n 2.  In practical terms, the conference produced much new evidence on the\n problem of disinformation, although not as much as hoped for, perhaps, on the\n semantic dimension per se.  Thirteen formal papers were prepared, and\n approximately 21 hours of discussion exist on tape.  Overall, the quality of\n the papers, oral presentations, and general discussions is quite high--\n probably the result of the participants' having been informed that some sort\n of conference proceedings would be published.  (How this will be accomplished\n is discussed below.)\n 3.  As you know, one of the primary purposes of the conference was to\n highlight the problem that we face in recognizing disinformation's various\n guises. In this regard, the conference was very successful.  The academic\n papers, especially the case studies, focused attention on specific\n manifestations of the problem.  This forced the audience, as well as the\n authors, to identify and recognize various forms of disinformation.  Perhaps\n even more useful, however, was the testimony--sometimes written, but more\n often off-the-cuff--of participating Soviet and East European defectors and\n emigres, whose accounts of their \"hands-on\" experience helped considerably to\n bring home the reality of disinformation's forms and techniques.  In fact, the\n conference was unique in bringing together such a large number of these ex-\n Soviets with academics and government specialists.  This compositional mix\n produced a good exchange of views and experiences.\n STAT\n ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n SUBJECT:  Follow-up to Disinformation Conference\n 4.  At the same time, the conference produced no consensus on the need\n for Western scholars to deal directly with the issue of disinformation in\n their work.  Indeed, the conference's final session reflected some marked\n differences of view among academics on this score.  Some argued the need not\n only to examine closely the \"ambiguity and contradictoriness\" of Soviet\n policy, but to take a \"moral\" position in doing so.  Others, while recognizing\n that disinformation is a significant factor in creating this \"ambiguity and\n contradictoriness,\" were clearly resistant to this notion, appearing to equate\n a \"moral\" position with a \"political\" one.\n 5.  These differences apparently reflected differing philosophical views\n as outlined by Norman Podhoretz in his keynote address. on the causes of\n Western vulnerability to semantic manipulation.  Despite this, the\n participants appeared to agree fully on the need for the government to\n neutralize and counter Soviet disinformation--primarily through greater\n efforts at consciousness-raising among the media and the public.\n Follow-up Steps\n 6.  In organizing the conference, we made clear that some sort of\n publication would result, and without exception all the conference\n participants strongly supported this intention.  We have considered publishing\n a simple compilation of the formal papers but decided that too much valuable\n information and analysis--especially that provided by the defectors--would be\n lost.  We therefore are having the taped proceedings transcribed as quickly as\n possible in order to prepare a conference report that includes synopses of the\n numerous oral presentations and discussions.  The report will be given broad\n dissemination by the State Department.\n 7.  A number of the conferees suggested that a list of participants would\n be useful to keep each other informed and to involve each other in related\n work as time passes.  Some saw this as a first step in helping to create a\n network of specialists interested in disinformation issues.  Accordingly, we\n have sent such a list (excluding the names of CIA staffers except me) to the\n conference participants.\n 8.  Another suggestion that many conferees made at the conference and in\n subsequent correspondence was to have a follow-up conference examine possible\n countermeasures.  A small sample of this correspondence is attached (including\n an earlier letter from Aaron Levenstein proposing the creation of a privately\n funded Center for Propaganda Research).\n 2\n ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n SUBJECT:  Follow-up to Disinformation Conference\n 9.

He\n spent his last two years in Prague\n directing a team of disinformation\n specialists who held freewheeling\n discussions, similar to those of\n Madison Avenue advertising agents,\n that led to disinformation proposals.\n \"It was public relations in\n reverse,\" Mr. Bittman said.\n Although he ended his intelli-\n enRe- career in 1968 after bein\n e    e   y U.S. intelligence ser-\n vices, Mr. Bittman said he continues\n to recognize Soviet disinformation\n programs in the U.S. press.\n Mr. Bittman defended the U.S.\n press for its critical judgment but\n added: 'As a former specialist, I\n would say there are a number of\n journalists in the American media\n that were recruited by the Soviets\n who work either for various\n prominent newspapers or for\n broadcast news media:' Mr. Bittman\n said.\n Agents in the media are asked to\n report stories based on outlines pro-\n vided by Soviet case officers. Usu-\n ally, planted stories publicize items\n that will damage U.S. foreign policy\n or a particularly anti-Soviet public\n figure, he said.\n He said the Soviets \"love forger-\n ies\" and used hundreds of forged\n documents against the West during\n the 1960s and early 1970s. In the\n mid-1970s, reports of forgeries\n declined because during the\n Watergate scandal forgeries prob-\n ably were considered counterpro-\n ductive, he said.\n Since the late 1970s, however, the\n Soviets have stepped up their use of\n forgeries, he said.\n One example of a KGB forgery'\n was a letter criticizing black athletes\n that was sent to Third World coun-\n tries just before the 1984 Olympic\n Games in Los Angeles. The letter\n purportedly was sent by the Ku Klux\n Klan but was identified by the FBI\n as a fake.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/10/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000302330043-7"

Casey sounded the\n alarm in September when he devoted one of his relatively\n rare public speeches to a description of the \"active meas-\n ures\" being employed by the KGB to subvert public opin-\n ion. Casey warned especially about \"disinformation\" -\n the planting by the Soviets of \"half-truths, lies, and rumors\n to discredit free-world policies or individuals.\" Disinfor-\n mation campaigns, Casey added, \"are projected and rein-\n forced by media manipulation. The Soviets conduct a\n massive worldwide effort to manipulate foreign media, thus\n transforming portions of the press into an unwitting prop-\n aganda machine.\"\n The main point of Casey's remarks was that Americans\n should brace themselves for an all-out disinformation assault\n on the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly\n known as Star Wars. Casey predicted \"a propaganda cam-\n paign likely to assume unprecedented proportions\" as the\n Soviets give \"high priority\" to mobilizing opposition to\n SDI \"among our allies and in our country.\"\n While Casey stopped short of suggesting that the KGB\n had recruited American journalists for its disinformation\n efforts. a Voice of America employee. Lisa Jameson. ar-\n ticulated just this suspicion in an October talk at Stanford\n University. Citing as her source two Soviet defectors who\n had posed as journalists while working for the KGB, Jame-\n son said the KGB may have hundreds of recruited agents\n among foreign journalists, including some in the United\n States, who are ''ready at any time to place prepared stories\n in their national media.\" Editor & Publisher was so per-\n turbed by this possibility that in a November 2 editorial it\n suggested it might be time \"we went back to attaching labels\n to stories that might be suspect as to their origins and facts. \"\n At the same time, readers of the Los Angeles Times were\n given reason to suspect that they had been the victims of\n \"active measures\" by the KGB. Richard Sybert. a special\n assistant to the secretary of defense, wrote in a letter to the\n Times. published on November 2, that a basically critical\n series on the Strategic Defense Initiative by Times reporter\n Robert Scheer \"was a masterpiece of disinformation.\"\n Complaining about a \"flood of pre-summit disinformation\n on the SDI, Sybert attacked Scheer and others for \"com-\n pletely false\" statements, \"myth,\" and \"fabrication.\"\n In a recent interview, Sybert said that he had not intended\n to accuse Scheer of disinformation in the sense of the term\n as used within the intelligence community. Rather, he had\n used \"disinformation\" to mean the use of factually wrong\n information, \"some of which does come from the Soviets.\"\n by \"people who either know it's wrong or who haven't\n done their homework.\" Scheer, said Sybert. had used straw\n men and red herrings to \"very skillfully present a bunch of\n alleged facts and disinform people.\" Sybert went on to say\n that he \"in no way intended to suggest that Scheer was an\n agent of Soviet propaganda, although this sort of thing lends\n itself to this purpose.\"\n Certainly, the Soviets are out to undermine the president's\n missile-defense initiative; just as certainly, many Americans\n - including scores of reputable scientists - are alarmed\n by the president's plan. The press has an obligation to do\n its own digging on the issue and to report all sides of the\n debate, including what critics - both foreign and domestic\n - have to say.\n U.S. officials have obligations, too. If they are going to\n allege a massive anti-SDI disinformation campaign aimed\n at the press by the KGB, they should take care not to make\n indiscriminate allegations of disinformation when that term\n has become virtually synonymous with intelligence activity\n And they should not regard agreement with Soviet views\n as a Soviet propaganda triumph. Such simplistic thinking\n can lead to hizarre conclusions.\n Take, for instance. Casey's assertion that a prime So-\n viet disinformation objective is to \"encourage Eu-\n ropean and American antinuclear groups to view the\n SDI program as threatening an increase in the nuclear arms\n race when, in fact, it promises the opposite.\" If the notion\n that SDI might spur the arms race is to be equated w ith\n Soviet propaganda, what is one to conclude about a passage\n in Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's pre-summit re-\n port to the president' In that report, a copy of which was\n leaked to the press. Weinberger warned that \"even a pr oh-\n able territorial [Soviet missilel defense would require us to\n increase the number of our offensive forces and their ability\n to penetrate Soviet defenses to assure that our operational\n plans could be executed.\" Surely the same logic applies in\n the case of a U.S. missile-defense system.\n Disinformation, evidently, can lurk in the unlikeliest\n places. Meanwhile, in-depth coverage of the debate over\n SDI would seem to be the best antidote to whatever dis-\n information Soviet intelligence agents might be trying to\n sneak into the U.S. press.\n Gilbert Cranbere tras editorial page editor of The Des Moines\n Register from 1975 to /982. he now teaches journalism at the\n University of Iowa.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/20: CIA-RDP90-00965R000200990021-2"

Dr. Shults,  good morning.\n Dr.  Shultz,  as I just men,tior.eu, we've said that there are\n lies, half-truths, planted stories and so forth under this\n umbrella of disinformation.   Specifically, give us an\n example of something, would you?   RICHARD SHULTZ:   Well,\n an example could be an agent of influence.   Disinformation\n is a whole range of political arid propaganda techniques,\n what we call influence techniques, that are used to try to\n affect politics in'another country.   Especially they're\n used against major adversaries.   So the objective would be\n to try to undermine the political leadership of a major\n adversary like the United States,  to undermine the\n institutions, to influence the policies, to split the\n United States from its allies.   And so for  20 years,  for\n example, the Soviets ran, a major campaign and it's still\n going today to atteZpt  to split the United States from its\n NATO allies.\n HARTMAN:   How big an operation is this in the Soviet\n Union?   SHULTZ:   It's a big operation..   They have a number\n of key bureaucratic elements that are involved, including\n the KGB and the international department,  but the\n important thing is that it extends well beyond the Soviet\n Union, wi,ere you finu in the West many agents and\n intelligence officers and even diplomats.\n HARTMAN:   What about here?

I find it extraordinary\n that we should give equal time\n to people who have been\n trained in the basic Leninist\n precepts, which hold that to tell\n the truth is a dirty bourgeois\n habit. For a revolutionary to lie\n and to' lie convincingly is not\n only a sign of intelligence, but\n imperative when furthering a\n revolutionary cause. How can\n you give equal time to people\n who believe that to tell the\n truth is stupid?\n USA TODAY: Why did you\n write The Spike? Was it be-\n cause some of your stories\n were spiked?\n George Shultz repeated this re-\n cently, he was not laughed out\n of court The evidence is now\n overwhelming and irrefutable.\n It's amazing that it takes years\n for these perceptions to pene-\n trate in America when they\n have been penetrating in Eu-\n rope for years.\n DeBORCHGRAVE: We now\n have a scholarly work, Dezin-\n formatsia, written by two Dem-\n ocrats, Richard Shultz of the\n Fletcher School of Law and Di-\n plomacy and Roy Godson of\n Georgetown University. They\n confirm that the Soviets are\n spending $3 billion to $4 billion\n a year on disinformation oper-\n ations in the Western media.\n USA TODAY: Do American\n journalists agree that disin-\n formation is a problem?\n De BORCHGRAVE: Until re-\n cently, the notion was pooh-\n poohed by the entire profes-\n sion. Many editors said that the\n American media were run by.\n people who were far too astute\n to allow anything so crass as\n Soviet disinformation.\n USA TODAY: But you think\n disinformation efforts In the\n USA are extensive?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: It's all-\n pervasive and all-intrusive. I\n think it is extraordinary that\n the editors of major American\n newspapers still reject that as-\n sertion and have the notion\n that if disinformation does go\n on, it doesn't go on in their pa-\n pers. Yet, you can actually spot\n it in their papers all the time.\n What do you call it then? Is it\n sheer ignorance?\n USA TODAY: How do they\n respond when it Is brought to\n their attention?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: Oh, yes.\n I had very important stories\n spiked. One was May 11, 1978,\n which was a French intelli-\n gence secret report document-\n ing the links between the. KGB\n and international terrorist\n groups operating in Western\n Europe. I flew to the United\n States on the Concorde with\n that story because it was too\n sensitive to be sent by telex.\n Things started getting unglued\n after a couple of hours. The sto-\n ry got shot down by people who\n simply could not believe that\n these kinds of things were go-\n ing on under the umbrella of\n detente.\n USA TODAY: Has the Euro-\n pean press been more open\n about disinformation?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: Yes, far\n more open. What was rejected\n by my editors as utter non-\n sense in 1978 has just been pub-\n lished by two people in a book\n called Terrorism: The Soviet\n Connection. Alexander Haig,\n when he first became secre-\n tary of state, went public with\n the accusation that much of the\n terrorism today is aided, abet-\n ted, and funded by the Soviets\n and their countries. He was\n laughed out of the court by the\n mass media, which dismissed\n it as Cold War rhetoric. When\n USA TODAY: How do you\n feel about that?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: It terri-\n fies me. I can't believe we are\n that naive. In many instances,\n we are terminally naive, which\n is more dangerous than suffer-\n ing from terminal cancer.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/12/21: CIA-RDP90-00965R000100260015-0"

I requested and was granted asylum in \norder to become an active participant in the struggle against co=unism \nand the KGB. Specifically my intent was to warn the United States govern-\nment about the new communist political and strategic threats resulting \nfrom KGB penetrations in the western governments and further to help \nthem in counteracting these threats.

I also resent the title which he gave to this article, \n-When the CIA Was Almost Wrecked\". In truth, it is necessary to state \nthat my disclosures did not damage these three major services. The \ndamage was effected by the KGB. by disclosures 'should be regarded as \nimportant contributions in revealing and neutralizing the KGB penetrat-\nions in the western services. The circumstances of history and my \npersonal knowledge of the KGB have put me in the position of a diag-\nnostician in discovering the penetrations in these services and in \nthe position of a doctor in helping to cure the malady.

Subsequent developments confirmed my predictions \nand warnings and for the first time penetrations and disinformation \nwere recognized as serious problems to be confronted.The validity of \nmy warnings about KGB penetrations was further confirmed by the \nnumerous indications of KGB successes. As you are aware KGB penetrationE \nhave now become an almost daily occurrence as evidenced by the recent \nKGB recruitment of a FBI Special Agent.I have played a significant role \nin eliminating KGB penetrations from the services of three major western \ncountries and in restoring their effectiveness. The extent of my \ncontribution cannot be fully judged by outsiders or by retired intell-\nigence officers.Only senior officers of the western intelligence \nservices are in a position to make such a judgment. I am especially \nproud of my contributions and my efforts. Without them some western \nservices would have remained penetrated and would have suffered \nirreparable losses including the total compromise of a number of their \nofficers and secret agents. I am convinced that my efforts would have \nbeen much more effective, viv-a-vis the American Services had it not \nbeen for the Watergate crisis.

Div. of JAYCOR \n205 South Whiting Street \nAlexandria, Va. 22304 \nDear Mr. Douglass Jr.: \nI wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation \nfor your review of my book, \"New Lies for Old\". Your review \nindeed shows a genuine concern for the subject of \"Strategic \nDisinformation \" and the failure of the West to deal witth it. \nI am impressed by your credentials and I agree that we have a \ncommon interest here. However, I am of the opinion that a dis-\ncussion, at the present time, would not be very fruitful. I am \npresently drafting a new book which, in some ways, is an exten-\nsion of \"New Lies for Old'. It will deal, inter alia, with the \ntechnology of disinformation. I am using my own methodology and \nresearch which will require clearance by the proper American author-\nities. Therefore, I would like to postpone your proposed discussion \nuntil I finish this new book. \nI would like, however, to make a few comments regarding your \nreview. I concur with your comment that the book is somewhat diff-\nicult to read. This is quite natural since the book is an academic \none.In fact most books on this subject, including articles such as \nyours, are difficult to read. As for the structure of the book, I \nmust explain that the original manuscript was very_IongconSiSting \nof three volumes. Volume one dealt with the struggle for power after \nthe death of Stalin and the adoption of the Soviet Bloc's long range \ngrand policy. (1953-1960.) Volume two dealt with Strategic Disinform-\nation . Volume three discussed the Communist strategies in detail. \nBecause of its length I compromised with my publisher to publish \nonly the second volume as \"New Lies for Old', since it was the \nmost important subject and the least known. Since it was taken out \nof context, both the logic and the credibility of the book was \nweakened: Volume one and volume three are being held in abeyance \nby the publisher awaiting their chances. I am convinced, however, \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \nthat they are not only important but that they are absolutely \nnecessary background reading in order to fully understand the \nsubject of \"Strategic Disinformaion\", as described in \"New Lies \nfor Old\". \nAs a gesture of my good will and my trust in you, I wish to state \nthat, if you are interested in reading the two unprinted volumes, I \ncan arrange it with the publisher to have them made available to you \nfor reading. Unfortunately, by agreement, this would have to be \neffected only in the New York offices of the publisher. I do believe \nthat such a reading would be most beneficial and it would keep our ties \nalive. Unfortunately, all correspondence on this matter, for security \nreasons, must be through the Dodd, Mead Publishing Company. \nSincerely, \nA.

Golitsyn To The Participants Of The Conference \nOn \"Disinformation In The Modern World\". \nGentlemen: \nI am indeed grateful for the invitation to participate in the \nconference on \"Disinformation In The Modern World\". Unfortunately \nI am unable to attend and personally participate. However, as a \nperson greatly concerned about this subject, I would like to \noffer for your consideration several points on \"Disinformation\" which \nare particularly relevant to your organization and to the political \nopposition in general. \n1) I am alarmed by the confusion on the subject of \"Disinformation\" \nMany people talk about it and write about it providing their own \ndefinitions of the word. I am of the opinion that these erroneous \ndefinitions and interpretations of communist disinformation are the \nprinciple causes for this wide-spread confusion.Some writers confuse \ndisinformation with limited covert operations and political action, \ndiscounting its long range strategic connection. Others confuse it \nwith propaganda and psychological warfare. We often speak about \ndisinformation in general terms lumping together strategic, political, \nmilitary, operational and tactical disinformation. All of this confusion \nin my view, can be eliminated or at least reduced, by giving a more \nconcrete and precise definition of \"Communist Strategic Disinformation\". \nMy definition of \"Communist Strategic Disinformation\", is as follows: \n\"Those secret operations or activities which are conducted by the \nentire Communist Bloc or by a number of its members in accordance \nwith a consistent design or a strategic plan to create favorable \nconditions for long range communist grand policies and strategies and \nto contribute to the success of these policies and strategies. \nThe essence of such operations is an active misrepresentation of \nthe true communist principle goals and strategies in order to \naccomplish them by influencing and inducing their western adversaries \nto contribute, albeit unwittingly, to the accomplishment of their \nobjectives. Such active misrepresentation is performed by the con-\ncealment of true information and by the calculated distortion and \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n2 \ndissemination of false information sometimes detrimental to them-\nselves and contradictory to their own propaganda. The communist \ncomponents involved include the Party, Assets of its Security and \nIntelligence Services, the controlled political opposition, Agents \nof influence inside and abroad, the communist press and their agents \nin place in the Western Media like in Pathe in France. \n2) Communist leaders including diplomats like Minister Gromyko \nand Ambassador Dobrynin, prominent scientists and writers all play \nan active role in this operation. Often the KGB and the Defense \nMinistries of Communist Countries, such as the USSR and China, conduct \nspecial supportive actions like faked border hostilities or public \nprotests in front of their respective embassies. \n3) The more exact definition of Strategic Disinformation, if \nunderstood, provides an opportunity to detedt, to understand and to \nanalyze concrete strategic disinformation operations and to see \nhow they serve the strategies. Let me dwell for a few moments on these \nconcrete stategies and try to explain them, not in academic terms \nas I did in my book, \"New Lies For Old\", but in simple pragmatic terms \nThere cannot be strategic disinformation in general. One must first \ngrasp the concrete strategy and then determine what specific dis-\ninformation activities serve and contribute to the success of the \nstrategy.For example there is thelong range communist policy for \ndeveloping mature socialist societies and for achieving world dominatior \nThis policy includes the military strategy of achieving the Communists \nBloc's military superiority through political-diplomatic negotiations \nwith the United States and through the receipt of western military \ntechnology by the USSR in the first phase and by China in the second \nphase. If one grasps this strategy one can better understand how its \nultimate success is served by the disinformation regarding the \nSino-Soviet split. \n4) Another communist strategy is its economic strategy whereby \nthey strive to develop their ecomonic-technical foundation so that \nit is superior to that of the west .This to be accomplished with \nthe help of western\nAlpP'r-olVed-f'orkeiea-se:-'2026/03/09 005259030cred1t . It does not \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n3 \nrequire much wisdom to see that the success of the second strategy is \nwell served by the \"Romanian Independence Disinformation\" and again \nby the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation. \n5) The European strategy is aimed at breaking up the NNTO \nalliance and at the withdrawal of United States forces from Europe \nthrough the German reunification and European security. Taking this \nstrategy into account one can realize how well it may be served by \nCeasescu's Independence Disinformation, by Honneker's raprochment \nwith Western Germany and by the coming introduction of the false \nliberalization and the use of controlled opposition in Eastern \nEurope. \n6) Another Communist third world strategy is aimed at the \nelimination of western influence in this area and the achievement \nof a United Front with the developing countries through the support \nof Wars of Liberation, by active diplomacy and by the use of a \nvariety of tactics on the part of individual communist states instead \nof one tactic of a communist monolith.If one takes this strategy into \naccount one can see that the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation, in \nfact the duality of actions, and particularly the Disinformation of \nTito's independence, served this strategy quite well. The late Tito \nalmost succeeded in taking these countries away from the west through \nthe so called \"Non-alligned Movement\". \n7) Since Communist Strategic Disinformation Operations are a \nproduct of the communist strategists ie man made, the clinical \nanalysis of their technology should be man made as well. In my view \nthis is a major task for western governments and their intelligence \nand counter-intelligence services. Without a solution of this task \none cannot expect either an understanding of communist strategic \ndisinformation in the west or a viable western policy toward the \ncommunist world. \n8) The conduct of communist strategic disinformation operations \nand the confusion it generates are big obstacles for the successful \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n4 \nfunctioning of genuine political opposition in the communist countries \nand abroad. I have come to the conclusion that unless the political \nopposition to the communist regimes realize the true essence of \nstrategic disinformation and its connection with their stategies, they \nwill make grave mistakes since they may be exploited skillfully by the \ncommunist strategists and they ,unwittingly, may even serve the \ncommunist strategists in achieving their goals. \nI have to be frank with you. I am concerned by your stated plans. \nAfter reading your, Statement of Principle, I have reached the con-\nclusion that your organization is moving in the wrong direction and \nthat you already may have made a big mistake. In your statement you stat \nthat you are trying to create and function as a United Front to fight \nagainst the Soviet totalitarianisms and against the military regimes \nimplying in the non-communist world as well. I fund this not only \nerroneous but also confusing and contrdictory. Why is it necessary \nfor you to combine two struggles? Why not limit your efforts to an \neffective struggle against the Soviet, Chinese, Polish, Cuban, \nCzechoslovakian, Romanian, North Korean and the rest of the communist \ntotalitarianisms as the main threats to the non-communist world \nand leave the other military dictatorships or regimes to the oppor-\ntunities of the democratic processes there and to the influence of \nother western governments and particularly to the quiet diplomacy of \nthe United States as verbalized by the American representative to \nthe United Nations, Ms. Jean Kirkpatrick. It appears that your plan to \nfight the military regimes, if applied to Latin America and Central \nAmerica, might put your organization in conflict with United States \npolicy in these areas. You may also find yhat your efforts to fight the \nmilitary dictatorships in these areas might be exploited by the Soviets \nwho support the struggle for liberation. Thus you may find that un-\nwittingly you are serving Soviet strategic plans. \nI sincerely hope that the foregoing on the threat of communist \nstrategic disinformation will assist you in understanding the danger \ninvolved in your United Front of two struggles and in making the \nnecessary corrections. Thank you for your attention and consideration. \nSincerely, \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030,1 1t cvn \n\fApproved for Rle: 2020/03109 C052590\neeas .su \nTRANSMITTAL SLIP \nDATE \nTO: C\")...e.._ \nROOM \nBU ING \n-1NO. \n1 \nREMARKS: \nCfi \n0 ...\" \nFROM: \nROOM NO. \nBUI DING \nEXTENSION \nFORM NO. \n1 FEB 55 \n241 \nREAA.CES FORM 36-8 \n\"I MAY BE \nW\" USED. \n(4T) \n`-- OPleasel 20201009 CO5259030"

Action required:  None.  This memorandum presents for\n your information some preliminary results on the structure of\n Soviet propaganda and disinformation, as gleaned from the first\n several hundred pages of transcripts from the Airlie House\n conference.  We estimate that the transcription of the entire\n proceedings, when completed, will comprise about 800 pages.  In\n addition, the 13 formal papers total almost 500 pages.  As I\n believe you are aware, we intend to synopsize the conference\n proceedings in a conference report that will include the formal\n papers.  The State Department will publish and disseminate the\n final product.\n Ideology and Language\n 2.  It was clear from the conference discussion that\n Marxist-Leninist theory determines the semantic structure of\n Soviet propaganda and disinformation.  The Soviet world view\n relates all human activities to world revolution.  In Soviet\n thinking, everything that promotes this process is good, right,\n and true, while everything that hampers it is bad, wrong, and\n false.  The dichotomy between Soviet \"socialism\" and Western\n \"capitalism\" results in numerous stereotypes in Soviet discourse\n and rules out certain others.  For example, \"Soviet imperialism\"\n is literally nonsense in terms of Marxist-Leninist ideology,\n inasmuch as the term \"imperialism\" is defined as a particular\n stage of capitalism.  Therefore, to the extent that these terms\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n CONFIDENTIAL\n SUBJECT:  Some Highlights From the Airlie House\n Discussion on Disinformation\n of reference are accepted by an audience, actual Soviet imperial\n behavior is unthinkable, a contradiction in terms.\n 3.  Two major campaigns in recent years illustrate how the\n .Soviet ideology sets the terms of international discourse.  The\n first is the so-called peace program, and the second is foreign\n \"nonintervention.\"  Soviet socialism is, by definition of the\n ideology, opposed to war and in favor of peace; only Western\n capitalists and imperialists are \"warmongers.\"  Thus, to be for\n the peace program means to be in favor of disarming the\n warmongering opposition.  Similarly, as socialists the Soviets\n would never admit that they \"intervene\" in another country's\n affairs--they have no such \"insidious designs.\"\n \"Nonintervention\" is a prescription applied to Western\n capitalists and means that Western countries should undertake no\n political or military resistance to the extension of communist\n revolution.\n 4.  As the above examples show, Soviet proNaganda and\n disinformation tend toward a stylized stereotyping, complete with\n required epithets. The Soviet government is never said to have\n \"designs,\" which connote an insidious character and are\n attributed to the US and the Pentagon.  The Soviet regime, on the\n contrary, always has \"plans\" which are \"creative.\"  In general,\n these stereotypes and epithets have evolved out of the ideology\n to connote an indisputable positiveness about Soviet life and an\n indisputable negativeness about Western life.  Interestingly, the\n negative stereotypes applied to the West often have, in Russian,\n an archaic flavor--perhaps reflecting the Soviet propagandists'\n attempt to portray the western world as obsolete and subject to\n being superseded by the next stage of history.\n Semantic Tactics\n 5.  The Soviets have developed a number of conscious and\n consistently applied tactics in the use of language to give\n ideological meaning to all concepts and strategies.  Because the\n Soviets believe that language and morality are inseparable--as\n moral values are dependent on language for realization--they\n engage in constant repetition of communist terms and constructs\n in order to condition people's thinking and create feelings of\n helplessness in the face of (what Soviets perceive and portray\n as) communist moral superiority.\n 6.  A related tactic that Soviet propagandists use is to\n alternate individually weak arguments in rapid succession in the\n hope that they will be convincing cumulatively.  One example of\n this would be the seemingly contradictory arguments about the\n impermissibility of nuclear war and the winnability of nuclear\n -2-\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n CONFIDENTIAL\n SUBJECT:  Some Highlights From the Airlie House\n Discussion on Disinformation\n war.  The overall effect is to suggest that the Soviets view\n nuclear war as morally impermissible but physically winnable--\n once again, putting themselves on the side of the angels.\n 7.  Similarly, the Soviets try to occupy the high ground\n through an offensive tactic of occupying a position of principled\n extremeness (the adversary is placed at the opposite extreme).\n Thus, as the Soviets see themselves occupying the extreme-\n principled left, the political word \"left\" must be placed in\n quotation marks if it refers to an adversary of the Soviet Union.\n 8.  Soviet propagandists try also to anticipate an\n opposition's objections by framing their own plans in a way to\n preempt the objections.  For example, if greater party control\n over scientific research is desired but expected to lead to\n objections from scientists that this will deaden scientific\n creativity, then the propagandist will anticipate the objection\n and state that \"tighter party control over scientific research is\n the way to enhance creativity.\"\n 9.  Another tactic is to try to discredit an adversary in\n the very characteristic for which he is esteemed.  Thus, Soviet\n propagandists attacked Alexander Ginsburg, the trustee of the\n Solzhensitzen Fund in the USSR, as a self-dealer and a wastrel,\n although he was noted for selfless devotion to his trust and a\n frugal way of life.  The history of regime attacks on prominent\n dissidents in recent years for allegedly self-seeking behavior is\n replete with examples of this tactic.  In the same way, because\n the US has a worldwide reputation as a rich,, free, and peaceful\n country, Soviet propagandists try to discredit it as not rich but\n either poor with millions of unemployed or profligate and\n wasteful, not free but enthralled to this or that oppressor in\n its society, and not peaceful but bellicose in its international\n behavior.\n Disinformation  P1 oys\n 10.  A standard tactic in disinformation campaigns involves\n the language of prejudice or self-deception.  As an example of\n prejudice, if an Asian or African politician becomes too pro-\n Western, the Soviets will label him as a CIA agent.  Although the\n politician may protest the falsity of the label, a residue of\n suspicion may remain (so the Soviets hope).  In trying to taKe\n advantage of self-deception, Soviet active measures play upon the\n audience's political and cultural biases, sending messages it\n wants to hear.  An example of this might be a campaign to\n convince the Indians that the CIA was trying to overthrow their\n government.  The campaign might be successful in India, although\n a similar ploy could not succeed in, say, Canada, because the\n -3-\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n CONFIDENTIAL\n SUBJECT:  Some Highlights From the Airlie House\n Discussion on Disinformation\n historical experience of Canadians would tell them, \"Nonsense,\n the Americans would not do this.\"\n 11.  Most propagandistic disinformation is an act of\n opportunity intended to promote the long-term interests of the\n Soviet Union.  For example, the Soviets probably were not\n concerned that their crude forgery of a Ku Klux Klan letter on\n the Olympics was exposed, because it was not designed for US\n audiences; rather, it would be likely to have Third World\n audiences in mind, and a long-term psychological aim may have\n been achieved.\n 12.  Because active measures serve long-term Soviet\n purposes, they must be carefully considered and prepared,\n requiring considerable time in planning.  Soviet propagandists\n and disinformation specialists, however, can and do avail\n themselves of arguments and debates that are openly aired inside\n an adversary's society, replaying critical views in an effort to\n justify Soviet positions to foreign and domestic audiences.\n During the first few months after they shot down the Korean\n airliner in 1983, for example, the Soviets collected stories from\n the Western press that supported their claim that the plane was\n on a spy mission.  Then, for a few months before the first\n anniversary of the shootdown, anticipating that it would be the\n subject of renewed Western interest and attacks on the Soviet\n Union, the regime started a disinformation campaign to claim that\n the plane was destroyed by a bomb placed on the plane by the CIA\n in order to destroy evidence of spying and cover tracks.  This\n follows a principle of Soviet rhetoric that parallels the Big Lie\n and might be called the Bigger and Bigger Lie--trying to show\n that what is good is growing better faster, and what is bad is\n growing worse faster.  This has been described as the \"constant\n crescendo.\"\n Conclusions\n 13.  The above highlights of the Airlie House conference,\n which far from exhaust its findings, reveal the organic link\n between Soviet ideological goals and their consistent, conscious\n pursuit of a complexly structured, purposeful program of\n propaganda and disinformation.  Despite, however, the verbal\n attachment to Marxism-Leninism and the use of what may be\n perceived in the West as ludicrous stereotypes, Soviet\n propagandists are capable of making rather crude adjustments to\n the philosophy and argumentation in order to explain\n discrepancies between theory and practice.  In fact, all\n participants agreed that a hallmark of Soviet propaganda and\n disinformation is flexibility.  This, of course, complicates even\n more the task of analyzing an already complicated problem.\n -4-\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n SUBJECT:  Some Highlights From the ~                              25X1\n Discussion on Disinformation\n Further work on this moving target is needed, involving more case\n studies.\n -5-\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3\n CONFIDENTIAL\n SUBJECT:  Some Highlights From the Airlie House\n Discussion on Disinformation\n DDI/BONA/NIG/\n (9 August 85)\n 25X1\n Distribution:\n Orig - Addressee (w/Attach)\n 1\n - ER\n 1\n - DDI\n 1\n - D/BONA\n 1\n - NIG Chrono\n -6-\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/22 :CIA-RDP89G01126R000100110022-3"

There\n is anothe-r way the Soviet government tries to-influence\n what happens around the world.   It's something called\n disinformation.   It's a well-organised, worldwide system\n of planted news stories, half-truths, lies, eves, forged\n documents at times.   Some experts believe the Kremlin is\n escalating its war of disinformation.   Richard Shultz is\n with the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts\n University.   He's co-author of a r1ajor new book on\n disinformation.   Richard Burt is our assistant secretary\n of state for European and Canadian affairs.   Arkady\n Shevchenko is a Soviet defector.   He now lives in the\n United States and he had a lot of firsthand experience\n with disinformatior, when he was a very high-ranking member\n of the Soviet mission at the U.N.   Mr.  Shevchenko, welcome\n back, and Mr. Burt, welcome.   Dr. Shults, good morning.\n Dr. Shultz, as I dust mentioned, we've said that there are\n lies, half-truths, planted stories and so forth under this\n umbrella of disinformation.   Specifically, give us an\n example of something, would you?   RICHARD SHULTZ:   Well,\n an example could be an agent of influence.   Disinformation\n is a whole range of political and propaganda techniques,\n what we call influence techniques, that are used to try to\n affect politics in another country.   Especially they're\n used against major adversaries.   So the objective would be\n to try to undermine the political leadership of a major\n adversary 'Like the United States,  to undermine the\n institutions, to influence the policies, to split the\n United States from its allies.   And so for 20 years,  for\n example, the Soviets ran a major campaign and it's still\n going today to attempt to split the United States from its\n NATO allies.\n HARTMAN:   How big an operation is this in the Soviet\n Union?   SHULTZ:   It's a big operation.   They have a number\n of key bureaucratic elements that are involved, including\n the KGB and the international department,  but the\n important thing is that it extends well beyond the Soviet\n Union, where you find in the West many agents and\n intelligence officers and even diplomats.\n HARTMAN:   What about here?  What about here in the United\n States?   How much is going on here,  for instance?   SHULTZ:\n Quite a bit.  We estimate that a large part of the Soviet\n official presence,  its intelligence,  is involved in\n disinformation, possibly with the bloc,  the East European\n Convnued\n Approved For Release 2008/09/22: CIA-RDP88-0107OR000201350013-5\n\f Approved For Release 2008/09/22 : CIA-RDP88-0107OR000201350013-5\n intelligence services, close to 500 officials who conduct\n disinformation or active measures.\n HARTMAN:   What's the message behind all this?   SHULTZ:\n Well, there are many.   I mean, there's a long-term message\n and that is that the United States is the major threat to\n peace in the wor'lu.\n HARTMAN:   That's what they're trying to get out.   SHULTL:\n Absolutely, and even in a period of detente, you know, in\n the early '70s when we were in detente, the message never\n changed.   So if you look at propaganda or secret\n techniques, the message was still there and amplified.\n The only change I see over 20 years is a much more\n sophisticated and a much larger effort on the part of the\n Soviets.\n HARTMAN:   Mr. Burt,  how serious a problem is this or how\n serious is it considered to be at the State Department and\n how do we react to it?   RICHARD BURT:   Well, David,  it was\n a problem that I think for many years was virtually\n ignored in the State Department.   It's really been in the\n last 3 , four years under the Reagan administration that\n we've Fegur, to take the problem seriously.   We started to\n actually document specific cases of Soviet disinformation.\n For example, the shooting down, of the KAL airliner.   We've\n uocuraented cases where, as Dr. Shultz pointed out, they\n have tried to drive a wedge within the alliance.  We have\n sent briefing teams around the world to talk to\n governments and the foreign press to again document these\n occurrences.   The problem is most serious in the Third\n World, where there is not a sophisticated press corp,\n where there is not sophisticated governments and where\n rumors can be easily spread and very difficult to\n disprove.\n HARTMAN:   Mr. Shevchenko, you have firsthand experience\n with this.   In your experience, for instance, at the\n United  Nations, give us an example, would you, of\n something the Soviet Union might do as these gentlemen are\n talking about?   ARKADY SHEVCHENKO:   Oh, a lot of things\n have been done in tie United Nations because there is a\n high level of representation of the Third World countries\n who come to the general assembly and to the session of the\n security council.   They could be easily fed with the false\n information and they are easy victims for the Soviet\n Union.   Coming back to one of the most successful,  I would\n say, disinformation conveyed by the Soviet Union,  I would\n like to mention the, you remember very well what kind of\n an image the Soviet proJecteu about late Soviet leader\n Yuri Andropov.   You remember the man who is a closet\n liberal, who is progressive, who is a reformist and so\n on, and you see how easily it was bought in the United\n States, and it's still even now, even now a lot of the\n Continued\n 02\n Approved For Release 2008/09/22 : CIA-RDP88-0107OR000201350013-5\n\f Approved For Release 2008/09/22 : CIA-RDP88-0107OR000201350013-5\n spoilers, a lot of the Soviet specialists in this country\n believe all that and all that was been planted by the KGB,\n by the orders uisinformation conveyed in the United\n States.\n HARTMAN:   What should the United States do, Mr.\n Shevchenko, to counter this disinformation from the Soviet\n Union?  How do we protect ourselves and the free world,\n the Third World, from this disinformation?   SHEVCHENKO:\n First of all, of course, it should be a major effort to\n analyze everything that the Soviets are doing and the best\n way, of course, to put them in the corner and discover\n something that they reveal a false information is there,\n and you know, what is also important, I think, that the\n State Department or relevant government agei,cy of the\n United States, they have to work with the press here, I\n think, with the mass media and to make each case which has\n been discovered either when it's a forgery or it's really\n am ueceptioii campaign, is to cover that extensively through\n the mass media, and then the people will better understand\n that.   Unfortunately, of course, it's like Dr. Shultz\n mentioned.   it's almost a forgotten area, you know.   For a\n long time in this country and in the West they didn't take\n it seriously, you know.   It kind of say, oh what,  'So what\n it could be some kind of a forgery,' but it's really a\n serious thing.\n HARTMAN:   Mr.  Burt, are we on track?   Just briefly, are we\n on track more now than we were?   BURT:   I think we are.\n We have something called the National Endowment for\n Democracy which allows us to aid democratic forces\n throughout the world, and 1 think this is a positive\n approach.   If we work towards a democracy and a free press\n and free institutions, disinformation can't survive.\n HARTMAN:   Mr. Burt,  thank you.   Dr. ShultL, good to have\n you with us, and Mr. Shevchenko, thank you.   Good to have\n you back.   Thank you, gentlemen.\n VT\n Approved For Release 2008/09/22 : CIA-RDP88-0107OR000201350013-5"

The Washington Post has now docu-\n mented a secret US campaign last summer to persuade\n the Libyan leader that he faced the threat of US bomb-\n ing and a possible coup.\n Many diplomatic observers say that such deception\n may have adverse consequences for the United States:\n ? It risks undermining the credibility of the US gov-\n ernment in the eyes of the Western allies.\n ? It conveys an image even to US adversaries that the\n administration is unpredictable.\n ? It enhances skepticism about official pronounce-\n ments from the White House and other branches of\n government.\n ? It is counterproductive diplomatically, because it\n tends to strengthen Colonel Qaddafl's visibility and\n compels other Arab states to come to his defense.\n \"Instead of having a coherent strategy toward\n Qaddafi, the administration has resorted to amateurish\n and potentially counterproductive measures,\" says Wil-\n liam Quandt, a former key official on the National\n Security Council staff. \"I have never seen disinfor-\n mation work.... You have to be very careful not to\n damage your own credibility in the process.\"\n According to the Post account, written by Bob\n Woodward of Watergate fame, the secret plan was de-\n scribed in a memorandum sent to President Reagan by\n national-security adviser John M. Poindexter and\n adopted on Aug. 14.\n The memo said the strategy \"is that it combines real\n and illusionary events - through a disinformation pro-\n gram - with the basic goal of making Gadhafi think\n that there is a high degree of internal opposition to him\n within Libya, that his key trusted aides are disloyal, that\n the US is about to move against him militarily,\" the Pbst\n said.\n Further, the newspaper said, the memo called for \"a\n series of closely coordinated events involving covert,\n diplomatic, military, and public action\" - a plan that\n Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs\n of Staff, voiced concern about.\n The US news media became involved in the affair\n when on Aug. 25 the Wall Street Journal, quoting admin-\n istration sources, reported that Qaddafi was planning\n new terrorist attacks and that the US and Libya were on\n a collision course. Bombarded by questions from journal-\n ists, White House press spokesman\n August termed the news report\n authlo  b \" Other\n published reports followed.     \"\n But the Pbst in it,\n Poindexter memo as sa\n -\n all had concluded                      omciais a\n iprrnnct      .                 was quiesoen  on\n The newspaper said the plan approved by Reagan did\n not specifically call for the planting of false stories, but a\n State Department Planning memo provided that the \"US\n government backgrounds media on (1) three-ring circus\n in Libya with in-fighting among groups jockeying for\n post-Gadhafi era, (2) threat of resurgent terrorism....\"\n Asked about the Pbst story, Mr. Speakes said Thurs-\n day that, according to Mr. Fbindexter, no attempt was\n made to provide disinformation to the US media and that\n the information in the Wall Street Journal article was\n generally correct.\" He refused to comment on whether\n there was a plan to deceive Qaddafi by spreading\n disinformation abroad-*\n Exposure of the disinformation plan is not expected\n to have an appreciable effect on American public opin-\n ion. Qaddafi is disliked, and ministration policy on\n Libya is widely approved.\n But the effect on the press, which was manipulated,\n could be considerable. There is a natural and historical\n adversarial relationship between press and President\n which may now be intensified.\n If the White House misled them about one issue,\n journalists ask, how can the news media be certain it is\n not misleading them about others?\n \"This creates an institutional problem for Reagan in\n the long run,\" says William Schneider, a media analyst at\n the American Enterprise Institute. \"It's better not to\n engage in disinformation, because the confidence of the\n press goes down and the relationship now is even more\n soured.\"\n Whether disinformation is a valid tool of diplomacy is\n a matter of opinion. Some diplomats say it is legitimate,\n especially in the case of a dangerous figure like Qaddafl.\n \"This is a nasty game and it happens everywhere,\" a\n European diplomat comments. \"But these things run the\n risk of being counterproductive. The key is not to have\n these things come out in the press. If the job is only half\n done, the thing bounces back in your face.\"\n Other diplomatic observers voice concern about the\n result of disinformation on friends of the United States.\n With US credibility impaired, critics say, it becomes more\n difficult to convince the allies to take action in the face of\n legitimate threats. \"The word of the United States ought\n to be valued,\" says William Charles Maynes, editor of\n Foreign Policy magazine. \"When we start devaluing the\n CAM\n J\n Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/27: CIA-RDP90-00965R000605760007-4\n\f Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/06/27: CIA-RDP90-00965R000605760007-4\n A\n word of the United States, that ... can be dangerous.\"\n Disinformation as a practice went out of fashion\n under the Carter administration. During the final phase\n of the Iranian revolutionary crisis, Mr. Quandt recalls,\n there was discussion of a disinformation campaign\n against Ayatollah. Ruhollah Khomeini using clandestine\n radio.\n But the idea never got off the ground before the Shah\n was overthrown and the Ayatollah came to power.\n The value of disinformation in achieving concrete\n results is also questioned. Many Middle East experts say\n that the Reagan policy of goading and\n under-\n mine Qaddafl has caused awkward problems for moder-\n ate leaders in the region and has not ended the threat of\n terrorism.\n \"This reflects a juvenile and ridiculous obsession with\n this small dictator, who is only a Pinprick in our side and\n no threat to our national security,\" says Talcott Seelye,\n former US ambassador to Syria.\n \"Anytime we get involved in trying to overthrow the\n head of a government, we will be shown up sooner or\n later and we the stigmatize the people we're trying to sup-\n and\n Seelye nd the s~uent regime is weakened,\" Ambassa-\n dora\n Diplomatic experts who travel to the Middle East say\n that the United States' closest friends are upset about\n the administration's fixation with Qaddafl, arguing that\n the US is simply making him more popular among radical\n elements.\n The l?bet article auo   S   Lary of ~tatp n~,,.~\n Shultz and CIA Director William J.

And President Reagan also denied government      involvement, but\n he  admitted  the White House did know about private American help\n to the Contras.\n PRESIDENT  REAGAN:    We've  been  aware  that  there  are\n private groups and private citizens that have been trying to help\n the  Contras,  to  that  extent.

Wasn't there a disinformation campaign?\n SENATOR WILLIAM       COHEN:    Well,  first  let me  be  very\n clear.   The committee  itself did not make an investigation.          The\n Chairman of the Intelligence Committee,        Dave Durenberger,  and the\n chief of staff,  Bernie McMahon,      made an  inquiry.   And   they  were\n satisfied   there  had  been  no,     quote,   official      campaign  for\n disinformation.  Which  is not  the   same  as saying    that stories  did\n not   leak  into the press  or  were  not        deliberately  leaked   by\n certain     individuals that  may     have  planted     false stories   or\n misleading  stories.   But    there   was   no evidence,    according to\n their inquiry, of an  official campaign  orchestrated and organized\n by     the White House.\n COLLINGS:   But  the White House spokesman,  Larry    Speakes,\n used   the  word  \"authoritative,\"  referring to  the  story,  as  if  it\n were deliberate and     intentional,  not  just...\n SENATOR COHEN: I   think  there   were  individuals     within\n the  State  Department,  perhaps  in  other  facets  of  the White House\n operation,  of    individuals who indeed  did believe  it  was   important\n to     try  and  disseminate  information that    might keep      Qaddafi,\n quote, off balance. I    think  that  they now  recognize  the     dangers\n in  using,  in any way,  the U.S. media to convey  information which\n is patently      false.\n COLLINGS:   Admiral Turner,  do you agree that  there is a\n danger in this,  or do you feel that  it's a good thing?\n ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD TURNER:   Oh,    I think disinformation\n can     be used quite to  our  advantage and it's  a      good  thing  to do\n from  time  to  time.    But  on  the one extreme,         you  can  have  a\n disinformation program that     disinforms only    one      person.   And  I\n could cite  an  actual   case         that  I participated  in where we did\n that  very  effectively  for  our country.\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n COLLINGS:    Can you cite that case?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Yes.   We tried to get  the ambassador    of\n a foreign country,        who was democratically inclined,  to go back to\n his  country and       engage  in  a  dispute  that  was  going  on  in  the\n government about whether it should be moved to the left.          And     we\n disinformed  this  ambassador  about  his  own  status  in          his  own\n country,     and he went home to take care of his own problem,    and we\n got  him     into the    fray  in fighting for the democratic side.       It\n was a very useful thing.           Didn't happen      to win, but nonetheless\n we  disinformed him       and  he     did  do what we wanted him  to do.\n COLLINGS:    Are you saying you lied?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:  Yes,  we lied  to him      and we made this\n man believe something was going        on that  affected him  in  his home\n country      that  was    not  going  on.   But we got  him back into the\n fray,  so to speak.\n On  the    other  extreme,     you  can  disinform  the  whole\n American     public,   or      the  whole  world, practically.    And    in\n thiscase,  the Administration         was  insensitive to the  degree which\n they   were  moving      away  from  a   single  disinformation  to a  very\n broad  disinformation.\n COLLINGS:   Arnaud de Borchgrave, the Soviet Union has a\n campaign     of disinformation,  as          we know. Aren't  we stooping to\n their  level  when  we     do the    same thing?\n ARNAUD  DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Well,     first, I  have  to make  a\n correction   about        the  Wall  Street      Journal story.          It   was\n authoritative.       As     a matter   of fact, what  was    happening   in\n Tripoli at  that     time was a meeting with President Assad     of Syria;\n Ghebril      (?), a  well-known  Palestinian  terrorist;     Abu    Moussa,\n another well-known Palestinian terrorist;  the head of the Iranian\n Revolutionary  Guards.      And French counterintelligence  happens      to\n know  that   they    were  at  that  very moment plotting some terrorist\n actions in Western Europe.\n COLLINGS:    But  we    know  that  Poindexter  talked   about\n Qaddafi being quiescent.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He was not  quiescent.   There was...\n COLLINGS:   Whatever  reports  there     were,  they   weren't\n clear that he was planning new terrorism.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Because we  in the  media  were  not     doing\n our  job.    They  put   out  a statement, the Libyan news agency -- I\n don't  know why we didn't pick    it up.   They said,  \"We   are    setting\n up     special  revolutionary  --  secret  revolutionary cells           in many\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n Western      countries  in  order to launch attacks against America in\n such  a  way    that  they  will  not  be  able  to  retaliate  with their\n aircrft      carriers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"    This\n was a direct quote          from the Libyan news agency.\n He  was  not  quiescent.   But  again, that's conventional\n wisdom right  away,   he was quiescent.\n As  for  the  Soviet Union,   you know that  they spend three\n to   four    billion        dollars  a  year on  active  measures, which\n encompasses all       forms  of disinformation.       We have printed as fact\n in our media countless Soviet  forgeries.            And  I could spend  the\n next two hours  reciting  them from memory.\n COLLINGS:   Well,  don't  do that,  because we want  to talk\n about American disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: We don't  get  involved  in that.   We do\n not  plant    disinformation in   our  own media.   As    the Admiral said,\n abroad  there are  some  disinformation       operations that  go on. But\n let's make quite clear that there is a major  difference        between\n strategic deception,  which we were involved in against Qaddafi to\n destabilize  him, psych  him,  psychological    warfare;  and    all that\n was  indeed  going  on, and    for  a  very good reason.   He considers\n himself to be  in a permanent state of war with the United States.\n COLLINGS:   Strategic deception.      Lying,  in other words.\n Do you approve?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:     Strategic   deception  in    a  military\n COLLINGS: Do you approve?\n SENATOR  COHEN:    I  think we  have  to    draw a distinction\n once again.  It's   one  thing  to have     ships steaming  toward  the\n coast  of Libya.   That  is    a fact  if we are doing it.   It's quite\n another to,    I  think, publish reports,  feed  reports   to American\n journalists  and  suggest      that there   is  a   coup  in the making to\n ovrethrow Qaddafi, that he     is  internally  unstable,  that  we  are\n giving  aid  and  comfort,  as  such,  to  those  forces  who wish   to\n overthrow   him,  when   in    fact   the   situation   might        be  quite\n different.\n As  far  as  Qaddafi himself,   it's perhaps a bad example.\n But  nonetheless what it does  is  it throws that  seed    of disbelief\n or  lack of credibility   out  there so that we are never believed.\n If in fact we have...\n COLLINGS: We have to take a break  at  this point,  and we\n will be right back.\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n COLLINGS:      On     Newsmaker   Saturday,   our   topic   is\n disinformation  and  credibility.\n Admiral   Turner,  in  World War II the United States lied\n about  the  location of  the   invasion  at  Normandy      in  order  to save\n lives   of  American soldiers.      That was wartime.   We're not  at war\n now,  and yet we are still     lying.   Why  is that?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:      There    are  some   times,   even   in\n peacetime,  when you do lie.   A     friend of mine,  for instance,  was\n asked by    a newspaperman the day  that    the Iranian rescue operation\n was  actually  taking  place,  \"Is  there  not  a      rescue  operation\n taking place?\"   And my  friend,    very   appropriately,  said,  \"No.\"\n He called   the    newsman   the next   day   and      said, \"I\n apologize.         I  deliberately  lied to you.   But there were lives at\n stake yesterday,  and so I could not even waffle my answer to you.\n I  had  to be categoric in  saying  no.\"\n COLLINGS:   So when lives are at stake,  it's all  right.\n Are there any  other conditions when it's all right?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   We  think of ourselves as being at peace\n and we think      of peace treaties and armistices and truces  and war\n and  declarations  of   war.   Some  our  adversaries in this day  and\n age  don't  think that  way.    They  consider themselves  to  be  in a\n permanent   state  of war  with Western  democracies,  albeit conducted\n through  indirect   means,  whether  it's  subversion  or  penetration or\n disinformation  or  state-sponsored  terrorism.\n COLLINGS: But    that's what  the.y consider.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Yes.\n COLLINGS:   Why should we     think  the  same way they  do?\n Why should we behave the same way    they do?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   If  people consider themselves    to be at\n war   against  the  citadel  of  capitalism  --  namely,  the     United\n States  --  as  they  call  it,  well,   then,  obviously we  have    to\n react.  And you're not    going to be conducting     this  according  to\n the Marquis    of Queensberry's  rules,  are you?\n COLLINGS:   Senator Cohen,  do you think we should use the\n same  means that  they do?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,  I  think  one  of the difficulties\n with  making  such   a  broad   statement is  that   if  you  adopt  the\n policies that  the Libyans   or the Soviets   or any  other countries\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n who  have  declared  war,   active  or  covert,   or  terroristic  or\n conventional,   against the United States,  it seems to me  if that's\n the general proposition,        then you can always say  it's open for us\n to deceive  the  enemy.    And   the  question is,  how  does  one  go about\n deceiving the enemy?\n It  seems to  me  that  if we adopt  that    as    a  general\n policy,  that  it's all  right    to put  deceptive  measures  into    the\n media  to    convey that    to  keep the  enemy guessing, then we  have  a\n question   of  when  do    the  American  people really  believe      that\n the  President   or the  White House or  the        Congress is  actually\n telling them the truth.        Right now...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      That's      our    job,         Senator. As\n journalists,     we  can't        be spoon-fed.     When  we  say  in  our\n profession,   \"We've      been   lied to,\"   that   is           sanctimonious,\n hypocritical  nonsense.         What  government    has  not  lied?   What\n government has not misled or tried to mislead the press?\n So, what are  we?   Are  we  journalists,    or  are we  just\n conveyor belts  for government      information?\n SENATOR COHEN:   That assumes that the government is in a\n state   of   constantly  lying to the press.   I don't believe that     to\n be the case.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: No,  it  isn't. But  we can see through\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   And that's what       was so foolish  in this\n case.   Because  the day  after the Wall  Street Journal printed that\n story,  Leslie Gelb  of the New York   Times just decimated it in his\n paper because it was a bad story.   And the Administration  should\n have recognized that   planting  something  like  that  in the U.S.\n media  was  bound to blow  up  in  their  face, as  it  did.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   They did not plant it  in the U.S. media.\n That has been determined. There was nothing planted  in the  U.S.\n media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:        That  certainly  is      not true. That's\n just  an assertion by...\n COLLINGS:   Disinformation?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE :   No.   No,  not  at all.   You can check it\n out.   And in fact,  the Intelligence Committee has checked it out.\n There  was  a memo   floating  around,  a  memo  floating around -- I\n think  the  Senator    can confirm      this. No  disinformation was\n planted in the U.S.     media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:            Oh, that's certainly untrue.\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   At that time?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   That's  certainly untrue.   Now,  it may\n not  have       been  authorized by the  President of  the  United  States,\n but  disinformation  was  planted by  somebody in the       Administration.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Even the Wall Street  Journal  will      tell\n you that they were not    victims        of disinformation.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well, they're  trying  to cover       their\n number,  too.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  No.        Because there were two things that\n were  correct  there,  Admiral,  and  we just  discussed  them  at  the\n top  of the program.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   You      have  heard  they are correct.   I\n don't     agree with what you said.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  You're not part  of the Administration.\n Here's someone who's  on the Intelligence Committee.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   He's  not part of the Administration.\n He's  in the Congress.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He's done his homework.   And Bernie Kalb\n resigned     on  the  strength  of    Bob  Woodward's  piece    in   the\n Washington     Post,  not   on  the   strength  of  anything  else    he\n discovered.\n COLLINGS:    All  right,  but  he  did  resign.    And  that\n implies that he  felt that the Administration had      lied and had,  in\n fact,    gotten caught lying.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: He  took  Bob  Woodward's piece    at  face\n value.      And  even  Bob  Woodward  corrected           his piece three days\n later.\n SENATOR     COHEN:   The  nature  of the problem is,  as we're\n seeing now with  the alleged involvement     in Nicaragua  of  the  CIA,\n if  you    took a poll  on the streets  of America,  I suppose that  the\n majority  would  come  back  and say,  \"We  don't     believe  the  denial.\"\n And that     is the difficulty that  one has  once you  are perceived to\n have been deceiving     or planting stories  or not  leveling with   the\n American  people.       It  tends  to undermine   everything, even when\n you're right.    That's sort     of the road you  walk  down. Once   you\n take  a     lie and give it  the   perfume    of truth, ultimately  what\n happens      is  truth has  the  perfume  of lies.    And  no matter how\n truthful  your  statement        might  be,   it is perceived   to  be a\n falsehood. And  that's      the  danger we  run.\n So,  we've got to have those circumstances under which we\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n in fact do engage in disinformation be very,  very clearly          spelled\n out  in our  own minds  as to when it's justified.   But  as a general\n policy,      we  lose,. ultimately,  when  we  are   perceived  to  have\n engaged      or pursue a policy  of engaging in disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    But  haven't  all  Administrations      had\n credibility gaps,  Senator?\n SENATOR COHEN:     Oh,  of       course. That's a     constant\n problem with the Congress,       as well: Do we have a credibility gap\n between what     we  say  and  what we  do?\n COLLINGS: How     does    this   Administration  compare  with\n others in terms     of credibility gap?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:      I  am yet to  meet  a  public   official,\n whether it's here  or abroad,        who doesn't speak with three voices:\n the      on-the-record    voice,     beyond-the-record  voice,    and   the\n background voice.  And sometimes they're 180 degrees apart.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:    But  if  you    look at  the  record,  this\n Administration's credibility has been challenged much more           often.\n I  look on   it  from a rather     parochial point    of  view\n because I worry  about another wave      of public  lack  of     confidence\n in  the  CIA.    And  these    two  events,  the  shooting down  of  the\n airplane in Nicaragua and the disinformation        against   Libya  are\n reviving     that again,      just as we  had  with the   mining of  the\n harbors      in Nicaragua  and  the  manual  of  assassination  and  the\n assassination    effort    against  a man  named Fadlallah  in Beirut.\n All of these...\n COLLINGS:   Well, what do you think is the extent   of CIA\n involvement     in Nicaragua?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER: Well,  I    think  there's  very   little\n question that the CIA is providing help and support and advice to\n these people who are  freebooters and are doing things down there.\n They're doing it  on the verge of the law.   I don't think       they're\n d\n oing anything technically  illegal.\n COLLINGS:     But when   they deny   it,   then\n credibility problem.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   They're perfectly proper in denying it.\n But  their  credibility     is bad  because  they're  working  on  the\n wording of  the  law,  not  on  the  spirit  and  the intent  of  the  law.\n DE   BORCHGRAVE:   Have you noticed, Admiral,        how  when\n somebody     goes down and fights against the communists in a Third\n World country he becomes a vulgar mercenary,     and if someone is\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n fighting   on  the  communists's  side  he  is  treated  with    awesome\n veneration?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   I  certainly don't  have any  veneration\n for the Sandinistas.   I don't know what    you're talking about.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  No, but an American was killed fighting\n with  the  Sandinistas  a      couple of years  ago,   and it  made  a\n paragraph  or two in the papers and he was called an       idealist.\n COLLINGS: Well,  we'll take a break  at this  point,   and\n then we'll be  right back.\n COLLINGS:     We're   talking   about   truth, lies   and,\n credibility....\n Admiral Turner,  how  much  long-term  damage is     being\n caused  to  the  CIA     and  to  the  Administration  by  the  kind  of\n credibility gap you've been talking about?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: I think  it's considerable   because  it's\n happened      over  a considerable period of time.   We must   remember,\n Tony,  that the  most  fundamental  strength     of   our  country  is a\n well-informed       electorate,   well-informed citizens. I think the\n citizens      have been  not  well  informed in   these  cases  and  the\n citizens      are  going to question   what  the government  says in the\n future.       And  that will  be  very injurious  to  our    democratic\n process.\n COLLINGS:    And yet  you yourself say that  disinformation\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:  Yes.\n COLLINGS:   How can you have it both ways?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:  Because you don't want  to disinform the\n American    public.     The  instance  I  cited  to you,  the  American\n public   never  knew  about  it, because  it        was a very  limited\n disinformation program.   You    have  to take   some risks  once  in  a\n while.      Disinforming  one  person  is  an extreme case.  Sometimes\n you disinform a larger group.       When you do it  overseas, which you\n really  should -- you     never should do it  in the United States --\n you are risking  that                     it  will   come back into the  United   States\n media  because  we  really  have     one world media. So,    again, you\n have to be very careful about     it.\n Much  of  the  disinformation  the United States needs to\n put  out really isn't disinformation.   It's getting into other\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n countries true information by surreptitious means,  often,       because\n it  won't   get  in any  other way.\n COLLINGS:    We'll  put  that  aside  and  just  talk  about\n disinformation.\n SENATOR  COHEN:    Just  to correct  a  point. Number one,\n the   CIA   was  not  involved   in  a  disinformation campaign,     for\n openers.   They  are not  involved.\n Number two,  I think that   the CIA has enjoyed an increase\n in its stature   in        the past four or  five  years. Certainly  the\n morale  is  much    higher  than it  has     been in recent years.   And I\n think that the public has taken a different  attitude toward the\n CIA,  in    view  of  the  kind  of  circumstances we  find ourselves in\n globally.\n Number  three, the    lack  of credibility,  I think, starts\n from the top-down.      A point you made in your opening  statement.\n It  seems   to  me  incomprehensible    as  to  why the  Administration\n would say no deal has been made with respect to Mr.  Daniloff.         A\n deal  clearly  was  made,     a bargain was     struck,  and they ought to\n say so.     Everybody else knows that.      And for the Administration,\n the President   to say,       \"No  trade,\"  it  simply   starts taking the\n shine off the credibility.      And that tends to filter down.\n But  as  far  as  the CIA  is  concerned,    we have known for\n several years the Administration does want to maintain a vigorous\n campaign    of support   for the Contras.   The CIA will         in  fact play a\n role  in that    support.     Both  Houses  of  Congress have voted  for\n such   a measure.       It's  waiting  for  conference  action   at this\n point.\n So,  I would say  it's somewhat misleading to suggest treat\n the CIA now has a lack  of credibility.         It's  something that may\n affect  all     of government,  to the extent  that we don't  level with\n people  on  items  that are   clearly   within  the  public  domain  and\n which common sense tells them...\n COLLINGS:    Let  me  ask  you  this.     Your committee has\n oversight   responsibility    for  the  intelligence  community.     How\n much  attention  do  you  devote    to the  question of  disinformation,\n to make sure that there's no violation  of      the  guidelines  on  not\n misleading the American public?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   We  maintain  a  very  vigorous  oversight\n program.   I     think that's why  we're    satisfied the  CIA  was  not\n involved    in   any disinformation campaign.   To the extent there\n were  individuals  within     the  White    House or within  the   State\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n Department   who   may   have  briefed   a  reporter  and   gave   him\n misinformation or disinformation,  that  should  not  be  attributed\n to the  CIA.   This  was  specifically  n of  a CIA program.   The CIA\n is looked at very closely by us.\n COLLINGS: Admiral,  you were about to make a point.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Well, I was going  to say  that  it  is\n illegal,  I  believe,  Senator,  today  for the  CIA  to support the\n Contras.\n SENATOR COHEN:   That's correct.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:  Other than with  intelligence  support.\n SENATOR COHEN: Other than with communications...\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Communications and intelligence.   So if\n they had any role in the airplane  incident,  it was an illegality.\n It may not be  illegal tomorrow,  if the Congress  passes             this new\n law,  but    it has been illegal up till now,   was   illegal  if they did\n something yesterday.\n I  think the  genesis of the whole Wall Street      [Journal]\n disinformation problem was a misinterpretation        by  the    CIA  of  an\n intelligence    report      that  said Qaddafi was  on the verge  of being\n able to be toppled.        I  think  they  fell  fur  that one  when  they\n shouldn't    have  because  they   wanted to believe  that.\n SENATOR COHEN:   Can I  kind  of just  contradict that   for  a\n moment?      The CIA  was  never  misled  by  any report  that  said Qaddafi\n was  on the verge       of being toppled.  From all the information that\n I  saw,  that  clearly was not the case.   That     information,  wherever\n it  came,    did not  come  from intelligence sources.\n COLLINGS:   Let me ask you about...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   The Admiral made a point        about   credibi-\n lity  and                       said     that it's very  important  that we not question  our\n government,    that we believe  our government.     I hope  that  in  this\n profession,           Admiral,  we never  stop  questioning our government.\n That's   part         of the democratic  process.   Always question   your\n government.           That's what makes  it  a healthy society.\n COLLINGS:           But the  government has   to   take   into\n consideratin  the  fact  that          it's being questioned by  the press.\n But  it has certain objectives,          which  include  goals  that  can  be\n achieved by lying,    in effect.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Every      Administration,  Tony,      tries\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4\n every Administration,      Tony,  tries to manage the news...\n COLLINGS:   There's a conflict built in there.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      ...and  put  the  best  face possible  on\n what  they're  doing.   And  our  job  in  the media is to try to see\n through it.\n COLLINGS:   Let  me  ask  you about the Soviets.   How much\n mileage do you  think they will get   out      of the problems          that  have\n cropped up recently with Administration credibility,     on Libya,      on\n Nicaragua, on other matters?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,   in a recent  item that  appeared in\n the       newspaper,     the   Soviet  Union   jumped   upon            Secretary\n Weinberger's  statement        that  the Soviets,  to the extent that they\n pulled any troops        out  of Afghanistan,  will only replace them with\n fresh  troops.   The Soviet paper clearly jumped on that                and said,\n \"We are surprised and shocked that a high          official  would engage\n in such,    quote, a falsehood.\"\n COLLINGS:   We have only  a few seconds  left.\n Admiral  Turner,     what's   your   view   on   the   Soviet\n exploitation of this credibility problem?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I think they  will  do everything\n they  can   to exploit   it.   I'm not  sure  it will get    them a lot of\n mileage,    truly.\n COLLINGS:   Arnaud?\n DE   BORCHGRAVE:   Our   problem  is  that  we're   choirboys\n trying to deal with Jack the Ripper.\n COLLINGS:  Okay.   That's all we have time  for.\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/12 : CIA-RDP90-00552R000201260008-4"

The CIA denied\n it.  And President      Reagan also denied government     involvement, but\n he  admitted  the White House  did  know  about  private   American help\n to the Contras.\n PRESIDENT  REAGAN:    We've  been  aware  that   there  are\n private groups and private citizens that have been trying to help\n the  Contras,  to  that  extent.     But  we  did not  know  the   exact\n particulars  of what they're doing.\n COLLINGS:    Some  critics  on  Capitol  Hill  thought  the\n Administration  knew  a  lot  more  than that.\n SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY:  The Administration  is skating   on\n the knife-edge of credibility.\n COLLINGS:    I'm Anthony Collings  in Washington.

Wasn't  there a  disinformation  campaign?\n SENATOR  WILLIAM  COHEN:    Well,   first  let   me  be very\n clear.   The committee   itself did not make an  investigation.      The\n Chairman of the Intelligence Committee,    Dave Durenberger,    and the\n chief  of   staff, Bernie  McMahon,  made an inquiry.    And   they were\n satisfied  there  had      been no,   quote, official  campaign      for\n disinformation. Which     is  not  the same as saying that  stories  did\n not  leak   into  the  press   or  were not deliberately     leaked   by\n certain     individuals that  may    have  planted   false  stories   or\n misleading  stories.     But  there   was  no evidence, according     to\n their inquiry, of an official campaign        orchestrated and organized\n by  the  White House.\n COLLINGS:   But  the White House  spokesman, Larry  Speakes,\n used  the   word  \"authoritative,\" referring  to  the  story,  as  if  it\n were  deliberate  and   intentional,  not  just...\n SENATOR COHEN:   I think  there were  individuals     within\n the  State  Department,  perhaps  in  other facets  of  the White  House\n operation,  of    individuals who  indeed  did believe it  was important\n to     try  and  disseminate         information that might keep Qaddafi,\n quote, off  balance.    I       think that they now  recognize  the dangers\n in  using,  in   any      way,  the U.S. media to convey information which\n is patently      false.\n COLLINGS:   Admiral Turner, do you agree that  there           is  a\n danger      in this,  or  do    you  feel  that  it's  a good thing?\n ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD       TURNER:  Oh,  I  think disinformation\n can     be  used quite  to  our  advantage and  it's a  good  thing  to      do\n from  time  to          time.   But on     the   one extreme, you  can  have  a\n disinformation program that   disinforms        only  one      person.   And  I\n could       cite an     actual  case that  I     participated in where we did\n that  very  effectively         for  our country.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n COLLINGS:   Can you cite that case?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:    Yes. We tried to get  the ambassador    of\n a  foreign country,  who was democratically    inclined,           to go back to\n his  country  and  engage  in  a  dispute  that   was  going  on  in the\n government  about  whether  it should  be moved to the  left.    And  we\n disinformed  this  ambassador       about his  own  status in    his own\n country,   and he  went home  to take care of  his own  problem, and  we\n got  him   into  the fray   in fighting   for the democratic side.    It\n was a very useful  thing.     Didn't happen        to win, but  nonetheless\n we  disinformed him  and  he  did do what  we  wanted him         to do.\n COLLINGS:   Are  you saying you   lied?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:     Yes,  we  lied  to him  and we made this\n man  believe  something  was  going on that  affected  him  in  his home\n country    that  was not  going on.   3ut  we  got  him   back  into the\n fray,  so to  speak.\n On   the      other    extreme,  you      can  disinform  the whole\n American     public, or   the  whole  world,   practically.      And  in\n thiscase,  the  Administration was    insensitive  to the       degree which\n they   were   moving away   from a single disinformation      to  a  very\n broad  disinformation.\n COLLINGS:    Arnaud de Borchgrave,  the Soviet Union has    a\n campaign   of disinformation,  as      we know. Aren't  we  stooping  to\n their  level  when  we do   the  same thing?\n ARNAUD DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Well,   first,  I   have  to make  a\n correction    about   the   Wall   Street  Journal   story.      It   was\n authoritative.    As    a   matter of fact,   what  was    happening  in\n Tripoli at  that  time was  a meeting with President Assad    of Syria;\n Ghebril    (?), a well-known   Palestinian  terrorist;  Abu      Moussa,\n another  well-known  Palestinian terrorist; the    head  of  the Iranian\n Revolutionary  Guards.      And French counterintelligence   happens  to\n know  that  they  were  at  that very moment plotting some     terrorist\n actions in  Western  Europe.\n COLLINGS:    But  we know that  Poindexter         talked about\n Qaddafi being quiescent.\n DE BORCHGRAVE: He was not  quiescent.   There was...\n COLLINGS:   Whatever  reports  there  were,           they weren't\n clear that he was planning new terrorism.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Because we  in the  media  were  not    doing\n our  fob.    They  put  out a statement,  the Libyan news  agency --   I\n don't  know  why  we didn't pick it  up.  They said,  \"We  are   setting\n up     special  revolutionary --  secret    revolutionary cells  in many\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n Western    countries in  order  to launch  attacks  against    America   in\n such  a  way  that  they  will  not  be  able to  retaliate       with their\n aircrft    carriers and   intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"        This\n was  a  direct  quote  from the  Libyan  news  agency.\n He  was  not  quiescent.   But  again,  that's conventional\n wisdom   right  away, he  was  quiescent.\n As  for  the  Soviet  Union,  you know that  they     spend three\n to   four  bil-lion    d ollars  a  year on    active   measures,     which\n encompasses    all  forms of  disinformation.       We  have  printed as fact\n in  our  media  countless   Soviet forgeries.       And I could  spend  the\n next two hours  reciting      them  from  memory.\n COLLINGS:   Well,  don't  do that,  because we want      to talk\n about  American disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:      We  don't  get involved       in that.   We do\n not  plant disinformation in    our  own media.     As  the Admiral    said,\n abroad  there are  some  disinformation       operations  that            go on. But\n let's  make quite clear  that  there  is  a  major  difference       between\n strategic  deception,  which    we  were  involved  in  against Qaddafi  to\n destabilize him,  psych him,   psychological        warfare;  and  all that\n was  indeed going   on,  and for           a very good reason. He  considers\n himself to be  in     a  permanent state  of  war   with the  United States.\n COLLINGS:   Strategic deception.         Lying, in  other words.\n Do you approve?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    Strategic  deception  in           a   military\n COLLINGS: Do you  approve?\n SENATOR COHEN:    I     think  we  have  to   draw a  distinction\n once again.          It's one thing to have   ships  steaming         toward the\n coast  of  Libya.  That  is  a  fact  if we  are doing it.          It's quite\n another  to,  I  think, publish reports, feed         reports  to   American\n journalists   and suggest  that        there  is  a  coup  in the   making to\n uvrethrow  Qaddafi, that he  is  internally         unstable,  that  we  are\n giving   aid  and comfort,  as  such,  to those  forces        who  wish  to\n overthrow    him,   when   in fact   the      situation      might  be quite\n different.\n As  far   as  Qaddafi himself, it's perhaps a bad example.\n But  nonetheless  what it does is  it  throws       that  seed  of  disbelief\n or  lack    of  credibility   out  there so that      we  are  never  believed.\n If  in fact we have...\n COLLINGS: We  have  to take  a  break  at    this  point,  and  we\n will be right back.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n COLLINGS:       On  Newsmaker   Saturday,     our   topic     is\n disinformation   and  credibility.\n Admiral    Turner,  in  World War II the United States lied\n about  the  location  of  the  invasion  at  Normandy     in order to  save\n lives   of  American soldiers.     That was wartime.   We're not  at war\n now,  and  yet  we  are still  lying.   Why is  that?\n ADMIRAL    TURNER:      There are     some   times,    even   in\n peacetime,    when you  do lie.   A  friend of mine,  for  instance, was\n asked by   a newspaperman the day that the Iranian rescue  operation\n was  actually  taking  place,  \"Is   there  not  a    rescue operation\n taking  place?\" And     my  friend, very   appropriately,  said,  \"No.\"\n He  called  the     newsman  the next   day   and   said,     \"I\n apologize.    I deliberately  lied to you.   But there were       lives  at\n stake yesterday,  and so I could not  even waffle my       answer to you.\n I  had  to be categoric in  saying  no.\"\n COLLINGS:   So when lives are at  stake,  it's  all  right.\n Are  there any other conditions when  it's all  right?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      We  think  of ourselves as being at peace\n and  we  think  of peace treaties    and  armistices  and  truces and   war\n and  declarations  of  war.    Some       our adversaries  in this day  and\n age  don't   think  that way.    They  consider themselves to  be  in     a\n permanent    state  of  war  with Western  democracies,  albeit conducted\n through indirect  means,      whether  it's subversion  or  penetration  or\n disinformation  or state-sponsored        terrorism.\n COLLINGS: But       that's what they  consider.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    Yes.\n COLLINGS:   Why     should we   think  the same way they  do?\n Why  should  we  behave the  same  way    they  do?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:     If  people consider  themselves to be at\n war  against  the citadel      of  capitalism  --  namely,  the  United\n States --    as  they call    it,  well,   then, obviously  we  have to\n react.    And you're not    going to be conducting  this   according to\n the Marquis    of Queensberry's    rules,  are you?\n COLLINGS:   Senator Cohen,  do you think  we should use the\n same means   that  they do?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,  I  think  one  of  the difficulties\n with making  such     a  broad  statement is  that  if  you  adopt  the\n policies that the Libyans    or the Soviets   or any other countries\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n who  have  declared  war,   active  or  covert,   or  terroristic  or\n conventional, against   the United States,  it seems to me  if that's\n the  general  proposition,   then  you can always say  it's open  for  us\n to deceive  the  enemy.   And the  question is,  how  does  one  go about\n deceiving the enemy?\n It       seems  to  me  that  if  we adopt  that  as     a  general\n policy,  that it's  all right  to put  deceptive  measures  into  the\n media  to  convey  that  to  keep the  enemy guessing, then we   have   a\n question   of when   do the  American  people  really  believe   that\n the  President       or the  White House or  the  Congress is actually\n telling them the truth.     Right  now...\n DE       BORCHGRAVE:      That's   our       job,   Senator.  As\n journalists,   we   can't      be spoon-fed.      When   we   say   in our\n profession,   \"We've    been   lied  to,\"   that  is sanctimonious,\n hypocritical  nonsense.      What  government    has    not   lied? What\n government has not misled  or tried to mislead the press?\n So, what are  we?  Are  we  journalists,            or are we just\n conveyor belts  for government     information?\n SENATOR COHEN:    That  assumes that  the government     is  in  a\n state  of  constantly  lying  to   the  press.    I don't believe that to\n be  the case.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    No,  it   isn't.   But  we can see through\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   And  that's  what  was  so  foolish   in this\n case.  Because  the day        after the Wall  Street Journal printed that\n story, Leslie Gelb  of the New York     Times just  decimated  it  in his\n paper  because           it  was  a bad story.   And  the administration should\n have   recognized            that planting something like  that  in the U.S.\n media  was  bound to blow  up  in  their  face,    as   it  did.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    They  did not plant it  in the U.S. media.\n That   has been determined.    There       was nothing  planted in the U.S.\n media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    That        certainly is not  true. That's\n just   an assertion  by...\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No.   No,  not  at  all.   You can check it\n out.   And in fact,  the       Intelligence Committee has checked  it out.\n There  was  a  memo  floating  around,  a  memo  floating around -- I\n think  the  Senator  can  confirm     this.  No         disinformation was\n planted         in the U.S.  media.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Oh, that's certainly  untrue.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    That's  certainly     untrue.   Now,  it may\n not  have      been  authorized by the  President of  the  United States,\n but  disinformation was  planted by     somebody  in  the  Administration.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Even the Wall    Street  Journal  will  tell\n you that       they were not victims    of disinformation.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    Well,   they're   trying to  cover  their\n number,  too.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No.        Because there were two things that\n were  correct  there,  Admiral, and     we  just  discussed  them  at  the\n top  of the program.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   You      have heard they are  correct.   I\n don't   agree  with  what you  said.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:     You're not part    of the Administration.\n Here's someone who's on the     Intelligence Committee.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    He's    not part  of  the  Administration.\n He's  in  the  Congress.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   He's  done his  homework.   And  Bernie Kalb\n resigned   on   the   strength     of   Bob   Woodward's     piece   in   the\n Washington    Post, not   on    the     strength  of      anything   else  he\n discovered.\n COLLINGS:    All  right,     but   he  did  resign.      And  that\n implies  that  he  felt that  the  Administration had   lied  and  had,    in\n fact,  gotten caught  lying.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:     He  took Bob  voodward's      piece   at  face\n value.    And  even  Bob  Woodward  corrected     his  piece  three      days\n later.\n SENATOR    COHEN:  The  nature     of  the problem  is, as we're\n seeing  now   with the alleged  involvement in    Nicaragua  of  the     CIA,\n if  you  took  a poll on the   streets  of    America,  I  suppose that the\n majority   would  come  back  and say,  \"We   don't believe the  denial.\"\n And  that  is  the  difficulty that  one  has    once you  are  perceived to\n have been deceiving   or planting stories  or not      leveling  with  the\n American  people.     It  tends  to  undermine    everything,    even    when\n you're  right.    That's sort  of  the  road  you    walk  down. Once  you\n take  a   lie  and  give  it  the perfume     of   truth,  ultimately    what\n happens    is truth  has  the  perfume    of  lies.   And  no matter     how\n truthful  your      statement  might    be,   it  is  perceived  to      be a\n falsehood.     And  that's the danger  we run.\n So,  we've got to have those  circumstances  under which  we\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n in fact\n do\n engage in disinformation be very,  very  clearly                 spelled\n out  in\n our\n own minds as to when  it's justified.   But  as a general\n policy,\n we\n lose,  ultimately,  when  we  are     perceived  to  have\n engaged\n or\n pursue a policy    of engaging in disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    But  haven't       all  Administrations          had\n credibility     gaps,  Senator?\n SENATOR  COHEN:    Oh,  of            course. That's a         constant\n problem with the Congress,      as well:          Do we have a credibility gap\n between  what  we  say           and  what  we do?\n COLLINGS:   How   does          this  Administration      compare  with\n others  in  terms  of  credibility  gap?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:              I  am yet to  meet  a  public    official,\n whether  it's          here  or  abroad,    who doesn't  speak  with  three voices:\n the     on-the-record            voice,     beyond-the-record  voice,         and  the\n background voice.  And sometimes they're 180 degrees apart.\n ADMIRAL          TURNER: But if  you  look      at   the  record,  this\n Administration's credibility has been challenged much more often.\n I   look         on  it  from  a rather  parochial  point          of view\n because  I  worry  about   another          wave  of public lack  of     confidence\n in  the  CIA.    And  these    two          events,  the    shooting down of  the\n airplane    in  Nicaragua  and  the         disinformation  against  Libya    are\n reviving    that again,              just as we  had  with  the   mining of   the\n harbors     in  Nicaragua  and           the manual  of assassination  and    the\n assassination    effort    against  a            man  named Fadlallah in Beirut.\n All of  these...\n COLLINGS:    Well,          what do you think    is the extent of CIA\n involvement     in Nicaragua?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    Well, I              think  there's  very  little\n question  that  the  CIA  is  providing help            and support  and advice to\n these people who are freebooters and are doing things down there.\n They're  doing  it  on  the  verge of the            law.    I don't  think they're\n doing anything technically  illegal.\n COLLINGS:      But   when   they   deny         it,       then   it's   a\n credibility     problem.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   They're perfectly  proper               in denying it.\n But  their  credibility     is  bad because    they're  working                on the\n wording of the  law,  not   on the spirit  and the  intent  of the law.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    Have you  noticed,   Admiral,  how            when\n somebody    goes down and    fights against  the communists  in a           Third\n World country he becomes a vulgar mercenary,  and if someone is\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n fighting   on  the  communists's  side  he  is  treated  with  awesome\n veneration?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:    I  certainly don't  have any veneration\n for the Sandinistas.   I don't know what    you're talking about.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No,  but an American was killed  fighting\n with  the  Sandinistas a     couple of  years  ago,   and  it  made  a\n paragraph  or  two in  the  papers  and  he was called  an  idealist.\n COLLINGS:   Well, we'll  take a  break at this  point,  and\n then we'll be  right back.\n COLLINGS:     We're   talking    about   truth, lies   and,\n credibility....\n Admiral  Turner, how     much long-term      damage  is  being\n caused  to  the  CIA  and   to  the  Administration     by   the kind  of\n credibility gap you've been talking about?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   I think  it's considerable      because it's\n happened   over  a considerable  period of  time.       We   must remember,\n Tony,  that the        most  fundamental  strength  of  our  country  is  a\n well-informed    electorate,    well-informed citizens.   I  think the\n citizens   have been  not    well informed      in  these    cases and  the\n citizens   are  going  to  question   what  the government says in the\n future.    And  that will    be  very    injurious  to  our democratic\n process.\n COLLINGS:  And yet   you yourself say        that disinformation\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Yes.\n COLLINGS:   How can you have  it   both ways?\n ADMIRAL     TURNER: Because you don't    want  to disinform the\n American  public.      The instance       I  cited  to  you, the   American\n public  never  knew  about   it,    because     it  was   a  very   limited\n disinformation program.   You  have  to       take  some  risks  once  in  a\n while.     Disinforming one  person  is  an extreme case.        Sometimes\n you disinform  a       larger group.   When you do  it  overseas, which you\n really  should --  you    never      should     do  it in the United States --\n you are risking                          that  it  will  come back  into  the  United  States\n media  because we  really  have         one  world  media. So,   again, you\n have  to be very       careful  about it.\n Much  of  the       disinformation    the  United States needs to\n put       out really isn't  disinformation.   It's getting into other\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n countries true information by  surreptitious means,  often,         because\n it  won't  get  in any  other way.\n COLLINGS:     We'll  put  that  aside  and  just  talk     about\n disinformation.\n SENATOR  COHEN:     Just  to correct  a  point. Number      one,\n the   CIA  was   not  involved   in  a  disinformation campaign,        for\n openers.   They  are  not  involved.\n Number two,  I  think  that  the CIA has enjoyed an increase\n in  its stature  in        the past  four or  five  years. Certainly    the\n morale  is  much   higher  than  it   has     been  in recent  years.   And I\n think that  the  public  has  taken  a  different       attitude toward the\n CIA,  in   view  of the  kind    of  circumstances we  find  ourselves   in\n globally.\n Number  three,  the       lack of  credibility,   I think, starts\n from  the  top-down. A   point  you  made  in     your  opening statement.\n It  seems  to me incomprehensible      as  to      why  the  Administration\n would say no deal has been made with       respect to Mr.   Daniloff.     A\n deal  clearly   was  made,  a bargain     was  struck,  and  they ought  to\n say so.    Everybody else knows that.         And  for the Administration,\n the President    to  say,  \"No    trade,\"  it   simply  starts  taking the\n shine off  the  credibility.    And  that     tends to  filter  down.\n But  as    far  as  the CIA  is concerned,   we have known   for\n several  years  the  Administration  does          want to maintain a vigorous\n campaign of support   for the Contras.        The CIA will in    fact play a\n role  in that   support.       Both Houses of  Congress have     voted  for\n such   a measure.    It's waiting     for    conference      action      at  this\n point.\n So,  I would say  it's somewhat  misleading to suggest     teat\n the CIA now has a lack  of credibility.   It's          something that  may\n affect   all    of government,  to the extent  that we aun't     level vith\n people   on items  that are   clearly  within   the     public  domain  and\n which  common sense  tells    them...\n COLLINGS:    Let  me  ask  you  this.       Your committee  has\n oversight  responsibility     for  the intelligence  community.         How\n much   attention do  you  devote    to the  question    of  disinformation,\n to make  sure  that  there's  no  violation of  the     guidelines  on  not\n misleading the American public?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   We  maintain  a  very     vigorous  oversight\n program.   I   think that's  why  we're     satisfied the  CIA          was  not\n involved   in  any   disinformation  campaign.          To the extent there\n were  individuals    within   the  White    House or    within  the   State\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n Department   who     may   have   briefed   a  reporter   and   gave   him\n misinformation  or   disinformation,  that  should  not  be  attributed\n to the  CIA.   This  was     specifically  n of  a CIA program.   The CIA\n is  looked at very closely by us.\n COLLINGS: Admiral,  you were about  to make a point.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I   was going  to say  that  it   is\n illegal,    I  believe,  Senator,   today  for the  CIA  to support    the\n Contras.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Other than with  intelligence  support.\n SENATOR COHEN:  Other than with communications...\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Communications and  intelligence.   So if\n they had any  role    in the airplane  incident, it was  an illegality.\n It  may not  be  illegal tomorrow,     if the  Congress  passes  this   new\n law,  but   it  has been  illegal  up  till  now, was  illegal  if  they did\n something   yesterday.\n I think  the  genesis  of  the whole Wall Street     [Journal]\n disinformation problem was a misinterpretation         by  the  CIA  of  an\n intelligence      report  that   said Qaddafi was on the   verge of being\n able to be toppled.    I  think  they  fell  for       that one when they\n shouldn't   have  because  they wanted to believe      that.\n SENATOR COHEN:   Can I kind  of just  contradict    that for  a\n moment?     The CIA was never misled by any  report  that  said Qaddafi\n was  on the verge  of being toppled.   From all the  information that\n I  saw,  that  clearly was  not the    case.    That information,  wherever\n it  came,   did not  come  from intelligence sources.\n COLLINGS:  Let me ask you       about...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   The Admiral made a point      about      credibi-\n lity  and                      said that  it's    very important  that we  not  question   our\n government,    that we believe  our government.   I  hope  that  in  this\n profession,  Admiral,  we     never  stop  questioning  our     government.\n That's   part of  the  democratic  process.   Always    question       your\n government. That's what makes  it  a healthy       society.\n COLLINGS:  But      the government    has   to             take into\n consideratin  the      fact  that it's being questioned  by  the press.\n But  it  has  certain  objectives,  which  include    goals that  can  be\n achieved by    lying,  in effect.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Every Administration,     Tony,   tries --\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n\f Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8\n every Administration,  Tony,  tries to manage the news...\n COLLINGS:  There's  a conflict  built  in there.\n DE BORCHGRAVE: ...and  put  the  best  face  possible  on\n what  they're  doing.    And  our  job  in  the  media  is  to          try  to see\n through  it.\n COLLINGS: Let  me   ask      you about the Soviets.   How much\n mileage  do  you  think they will  get  out    of  the  problems       that have\n cropped up  recently with Administration credibility,  on Libya,         on\n Nicaragua, on  other  matters?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well, in a recent  item that  appeared      in\n the     newspaper,  the    Soviet       Union    jumped   upon    Secretary\n Weinberger's  statement      that  the  Soviets,   to the extent  that  they\n pulled any troops   out  of Afghanistan,  will     only replace them with\n fresh  troops.   The  Soviet  paper     clearly  jumped on  that  and  said,\n \"We are surprised and shocked that  a high         official  would   engage\n in such,  quote,  a falsehood.\"\n COLLINGS:   We have  only  a few seconds  left.\n Admiral   Turner,     what's   your      view   on the     Soviet\n exploitation  of  this  credibility     problem?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I  think they  will  do everything\n they  can  to exploit it.     I'm not  sure  it    will get  them a lot  of\n mileage,  truly.\n DE   BORCHGRAVE:    Our   problem  is    that   we're   choirboys\n trying to deal with Jack the Ripper.\n COLLINGS:   Okay.   That's   all we have time  for.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460004-8"

Action required:   Attachment A to this information\n memorandum presents for your approval a tentative agenda for our\n planned conference on disinformation.   At Attachment B is a\n similar agenda, containing a first cut at identifying possible\n speakers,  for your comment.\n 2.   Our consultation with outside scholars and State\n Department officials helped to clarify the important substantive\n issues for the proposed conference.   The attached agenda\n represents what the CIA members of the consultative group\n distilled  from the ideas raised at the meeting.   We are sending\n this draft agenda to our consultants for their comments and\n suggestions on speakers for specific topics.   (The group's\n members are listed  in Attachment C.)\n 3.   It was clear from the outset that the notions variously\n described as \"semantic pollution,\"  \"disinformation,\" and\n \"propaganda rhetoric\" added up to something everyone around the\n table generally understood and agreed was important, but not to a\n single concept the group could easily define.   The group decided\n to broaden the focus beyond \"disinformation,\" because it failed\n to encompass a whole range of important and related  issues:   how\n messages impact on different target audiences and why Western\n audiences are so susceptible to  images introduced  from the\n outside and so inarticulate and slack in response;   the linkage\n between language and culture  (how rhetoric reflects cultural\n attitudes and modes of thinking);  the historical dimension  (how\n values and meanings attached to words evolve);  the international\n relations context of propaganda; how the nature of modern\n communications affects the ways in which verbal warfare is waged\n and perceptions are created and cultivated;  and the  important\n underlying role of ideology.   By the close of the meeting there\n was general agreement that.the proposed conference should span    25X1\n CONFIDENTIAL\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/01/04: CIA-RDP88B00443R000301380014-5\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/01/04: CIA-RDP88B00443R000301380014-5\n CONFIDENTIAL\n SUBJECT:   Results of 24 January Consultation on the\n Semantics of Disinformation\n both the rhetoric of political discourse and the techniques of\n disinformation.   We also agreed that to be manageable and\n coherent,  it should focus on the Soviet Union--the main source of\n the rhetoric and disinformation with which we are primarily       25X1\n concerned.\n 4.                       lexpressed the view that if the conference\n is to have tangible impact it should result in policy guidelines\n for effective counter-efforts.   The consensus of the group,\n however, was that a prescription for counteraction should be\n reserved for follow-on deliberation and that the proposed\n conference should pursue the first-step goals of heightening\n awareness of the problem and elucidating its dimensions.   That is\n a tall order  in itself.\n 5.   The group settled tentatively on a title like\n \"Contemporary Soviet Propaganda and Disinformation\" and decided\n that two days would be a reasonable length for the conference.\n As Attachment A indicates, we envisage an introductory overview,\n a discussion of the ideological  framework, and a series of case\n studies that would elucidate various aspects--the historical\n dimension,  the cultural and political contexts,  the nature of the\n Soviet propaganda apparatus,  and the rhetorical  techniques that\n are brought into play--as well as a concluding assessment.   The\n case-study approach seems the best way to attack a problem so\n resistant to prec'    dpfinif-' 7n.   It was felt that speakers\n should  include                as well as Western scholars.\n 6.   The audience probably should represent a range of\n disciplines and professions,  including journalists,  former\n negotiators, psychologists,  semanticists, political  scientists,\n public opinion and marketing people,  Kremlinologists,  and\n propaganda analysts.   We recognize that more needs to be done in\n introducing more specialized skills  (semanticists,  psychologists,\n etc.)  into the list of participants at Attachment B, and are\n working on this.\n 7.

And it is\n currently being dramatized in the trial in Norway\n of Arne Treholt, charged as a Soviet spy and agent\n of influence.\n Disinformation, then, is not just historical. It is\n Dresent tv av as a svstematized function of the\n KGB, the Soviet secret police, as well as Soviet-\n bloc secret services. It is present whenever govern-\n rnents exercise \"news management\" that sup-\n presses unpleasant facts. It is present when public\n relations iri agemaking goes :beyond putting the\n best face on a political candidate to present a to-\n tally artificial picture of that candidate 1   or to\n smear a rival.\n Just what is disinformat ion?\n Simply put, it is the deliberate planting of false\n or misleading political information to influence ei-\n ther public or elite opinion. It is not just misinfor-\n mation, or mistaken information.. It is deliberately\n false.\n It is not overt propaganda,.-in which the true\n speaker is identified, however outrageous his\n viewpoint. It is planted information, with the\n source secret or disguised.\n It could be especially distorting in our much-\n vaunted Information Age, dependent as it is on all\n those facts stored in the computers.          -\n Disinformation is both more and less pervasive\n than the man in the street wants to acknowledge\n today. On the one hand, the democrat who trusts\n in the free market of ideas instinctively shrinks\n from thinking he can be manipulated by disinfor-\n mation he doesn't detect. On the other hand, the\n patriot who is vexed by intractable world prob-\n lems instinctively would like to blame all his coun-\n try's troubles on this easy single-cause theory of\n conspiracy.\n The 'first point to be made about disinfor-\n mation, then, is that the phenomenon does exist,\n and that it can be used to devastating effect, espe-\n cially in . character assassination of targeted\n .persons.\n The second point is that disinformation is no\n magic key.. It doesn't begin to explain the icom-\n plexities of Soviet-American conflict, say, or pre-\n scribe what foreign policies one should follow.\n The. third point is that disinformation is ulti-\n mately vulnerable to truth, since exposure can\n only reveal its divergence from reality. This axiom\n might seem banal, were it not for the frequent re-\n flex of governments to. fight disinformation not\n with truth ibut with counterdisinformation of their\n own.\n At this point some examples might help-clarify\n 'how disinformation works.\n The classic case in terms .of longevity and, dam-\n a90 must be the fake \".Protocols of the Learned El-\n ders of Zion.\" This turn-of-the-century Russian\n account of a purported Jewish conspiracy to en-\n slave the Christian world was used by Russians to.\n blackmail Jews 'in World War I. In 1921 the Times\n of London -exposed the Protocols as having been\n plagiarized from a .19th-century. anti-Semitic\n novel. But that didn't prevent Hitler from picking\n them up to help his persecution and attempted\n annihilation of Jews.'\n Today,- 60 years after the Protocols were de\n bunked, they are still sometimes cited as authentic\n in the Arab world.\n Usually disinformation is less brazen than the\n Protocols. The more common variety is a partial\n lie tucked into truthful- surroundings to enhance\n credibility. Or it is a fact falsely attributed. Or it is\n extreme exaggeration designed to mislead by sup-\n pressing all contrary evidence. Or it-is a red her-\n ring to lure. the unwary away from what they\n should be paying attention to.\n Highly effective use was made - apparently -\n of the partial he in the 1924 election in Britain. To\n this day historians are not satisfied that they\n know the full story about the letter purportedly\n written by Grigory Zinoviev, Soviet president of\n the Communist International, to the tiny British\n Communist Party with instructions to set up cells\n in the British Army.

As a result Labour\n was out of office for the next five years.\n The origins of modern disinformation are\n disputed. Lenin certainly extolled the virtue of the.\n lie. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels was no\n slouch at it in Nazi Germany.\n .\n the 1970s. Israel was apparently willing to practice\n disinformation even on its main ally when it\n strafed and torpedoed the USS, Liberty, an elec-\n tronic monitoring ship, during the 1967 war, then\n tried to cover it up through all channels as a case\n of mistaken identity. By now the general assump--\n lion seems to he that any secret service worth its\n salt will engage in manipulation of public and elite\n opinion in other countries.\n Certainly the Soviets - put enough stock in\n disinformation to institutionalize it in 1959 in De-\n partment D of the KGB. And a decade later they\n upgraded the operation by assigning it to Service..,\n A of the First Directorate,. responsible for all co-\n AN Nowak of the Polish resistance during\n World War II believes his organization in-\n vented many of today's disinformation\n techniques as it harassed the German occu-\n piers  .

Democrats accuse the Reagan ad-\n ministration of disinformation in waiting until just\n after election day to discover that the federal defi-\n cit is roughly $30 billion larger than previously\n thought. Outgoing US Ambassador to the United\n Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick accuses political adver-\n saries of disinformation in presenting her as\n some kind of right-wing extremist.\"\n Accuracy in Media, Inc., accuses CBS and\n NBC of spreading Soviet propaganda.

'10022\n (212) 751-4000\n ALL Rf&TS\n is RFSERVicit Or, Whir the CIA Cannot\n Verify an Arms-Control Agreement\n Edward Jay Epstein\n HEN  Secretary of Defense Caspar\n W Weinberger revealed last April that\n the Soviet Union had achieved superiority over\n the United States in intercontinental missiles, he\n provoked a furor in Congress over the status of\n the nuclear balance. Weinberger's revelation also\n pointed to an intelligence failure of unprecedented\n proportions that extended back over two decades,\n and that cast a great shadow of doubt over the\n capacity of the United States to keep accurate track\n of the Soviet military arsenal and therefore to verify\n any arms-control agreement with the Soviet Union\n in the future.\n In 1961, the Soviet Union, despite all its bluff\n and bluster, had deployed only four cumbersome\n and unreliable intercontinental missiles. U.S. intelli-\n gence had confidently asserted that there was no\n way the Soviet Union cot-.!d ever deploy the ntttn-\n her of missiles nereccarv to threaten the ranirlly ex-\n panding American missile force without providing\n years of advance warning.\n Such confidence then seemed fully warranted, as\n U.S. intelligence had through its technical wizardry\n found means of intercepting virtually all the Soviet\n missile-testing d;.ta, or teleme,ry, and of determin-\n ing the accuracy of the missiles. It was on the basis\n of this powerful array of intelligence about Soviet\n activity that American leaders made crucial deci-\n sions throughout the 1960's concerning the number,\n location, and defense of America's missiles.\n Yet in the event, these intelligence assumptions\n proved to be seriously flawed. Even though its mis-\n sile testing was being relentlessly monitored by\n America's electronic sentinels in space and on land,\n the Soviet Union, without alerting U.S. intelli-\n gence, managed to develop-and deploy-missiles\n with multiple warheads accurate enough to attack\n the most hardened missile silos in the United States.\n EowARn JAY EPSTEIY writes often on issues of intelligence.\n Among his books in this field are Legend: The Secret\n World of Lee Harvey Oswald and Inquest: The kl'arren\n Commission and the Establishment of Truth. He has also\n contributed articles to the New Yorker, the New York\n Tines Magazine, and  COMMENTARY  (including \"The War\n Within the CIA,\" August 1978). Mr. Epstein's latest book\n is The Rise and Fall of Diamonds (Simon & Schuster).\n 2 4 JUN 1y3Z\n How could such a massive development not have\n been detected?\n At first, explanations for this incredible intelli-\n gence failure tended to focus on the errors of the\n American analysts. The inability to see improved\n Soviet missile accuracy was attributed either to the\n prevailing disposition grossly  to underestimate\n Soviet technical competence, or to incorrect assump-\n tions about the method by which Soviet scientists\n tested missile accuracy. The fault, in other words,\n lay in self-deception.\n However, when the data taken from the Soviet\n missiles were studied in retrospect, with the help of\n new and better methods of analysis, it appeared that\n considerably more was involved in the intelligence\n failure than American mistakes and self-deception.\n This reanalysis suggested that the Soviet Union had\n deliberately and systematically misled American in-\n telligence by manipulating and \"biasing.\" as it is\n called, the missile transmissions that were being in-\n tercepted. In other words, by channeling doctored\n data into our most sophisticated scientific spying de-\n vices, Soviet intelligence had duped the satellites\n and antennas on which American intelligence had\n come to depend. The Soviets had thereby effected a\n decisive change in the delicate balance of strategic\n missiles.\n After nearly a decade of bitter debate within the\n secret world of intelligence, the deception issue still\n remains unresolved. Recently a plan was drawn up\n by the National Security Council staff to pace tech-\n nical as well as human spies under the scrutiny of a\n centralized counterintelligence authority. The pro-\n ponents of this reorganization argue that without\n such an \"all-source\" unit, able to piece together in-\n formation from secret agents, surveillance cameras,\n and the interception of coded messages and tele-\n metry, the various intelligence-gathering services\n could again be easily deceived. The opponents of\n this plan in the American intelligence agencies\n doubt that the Soviets ever in fact orchestrated a\n massive deception of our highly sophisticated moni-\n toring devices, and reject the proposed centraliza-\n tion as unnecessary and destructive of morale. The\n deep and intense divisions over this plan were re-\n flected in the sudden resignation of Admiral Bobby\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n\f Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n 1st tc rirnu\n 22/COMMENTARY JULY 1982\n Inman, who opposed it, as the Deputy Director of\n the CIA.\n Thus, at the core of the dispute is not merely a\n jurisdictional struggle over who should test the\n probity of exotic intelligence, but a powerful dis-\n agreement over the vulnerability of American in-\n telligence to deception on matters of vital national\n security. With a multibillion-dollar global intelli-\n gence system at our command, have we nonetheless\n been consistently misled by fraudulent bits of infor-\n mation? And if so, is there anything we can do\n to make certain it will never happen again?\n D FCEPTION among nations is not of course\n a new subject in power politics. As\n early as the 16th century Machiavelli concluded\n that there were only two means for a nation to gain\n its objective from an unwilling adversary: force or\n fraud. Since the application of force entailed ex-\n pending resources and taking serious risks, Machia-\n velli strongly recommended that a ruler should\n \"never attempt to win by force what he might\n otherwise win by fraud.\" The .basic economy of\n power that 'Machiavelli described is, if anything,\n pvPn mnre relevant in an age of mlrlear weapons.\n To be successful, fraud requires changing an ad-\n versary's perceptions of reality. It is commonly em-\n plnyed in wartime to mislead an enemy into believ-\n ing that a military force is either stronger or weaker\n than it is in reality; indeed, as the Chinese strategist\n Sun Tzu wrote in the 4th century B.C.E., \"All war-\n fare is based on deception.\" In peacetime, though\n its applications are far less obvious, fraud still re-\n mains an effective means of altering the geopolitical\n balance of power. These peacetime frauds are usual-\n ly perpetrated on an adversary's intelligence-gather-\n ing system on the presumption that the fraudulent\n intelligence will eventually reach and influence deci-\n sion-makers.\n Consider, for example, one such case that took\n place in New York City in the 1960's and early 70's.\n It began when a KGB officer working at the United\n Nations Secretariat contacted the FBI and offered\n to betray the Soviet Union by supplying secret in-\n formation. He claimed that the KGB had mis-\n treated him by taking back part of his UN salary,\n and he asked the FBI to pay him for his services.\n The FBI accepted his terms and gave him the code\n name \"Fedora.\" Since Fedora would continue to\n work for the KGB while also working for the FBI,\n he was considered to be a double agent.\n Fedora told the FBI that the KGB had ordered\n him to organize a spy ring in New York that would\n ferret out American scientific secrets-especially\n those involving defense and missile technology. By\n reporting all the activities and targets of this scien-\n tific spying to the FBI, he could provide American\n intelligence with information about the priorities\n of Soviet intelligence. As the relationship devel-\n oped, Fedora also acted as a \"mole\" in the KGB,\n and passed on a continuous flow of secret data.\n Later that year, the FBI had another Soviet\n \"walk-in,\" as a volunteer is called, from the UN. He\n identified himself as an officer in Soviet military in-\n telligence, the GRU, and explained that he was in\n New York, under UN cover, attempting to ferret\n out American military secrets in overt literature.\n He also offered to work for the FBI as a double\n agent, and he was given the code name \"Tophat.\"\n For the next ten years, Fedora and Tophat pro-\n vided the FBI with dovetailing bits of information\n on the development of Soviet weaponrywhich were\n brought at times by J. Edgar Hoover directly to\n the attention of the President and his National\n Security Adviser. Some of these reports were indeed\n responsible for provoking serious changes id the de-\n fense strategy of the United States. In 1969, for in-\n stance, Hoover in a personal briefing informed\n President Nixon that the FBI had established\n through super-secret sources (i.e., Fedora and Top-\n hat) that the Soviet Union was on the brink of\n launching a crash program to develop chemical-\n biological weapons. Specifically, Fedora had learned\n that Soviet leaders had been shocked to discover\n that the United States had a decisive lead in this\n field and believed that even with a crash Program it\n would take years to narrow the gap. It further ap-\n peared, according to Tophat, that Soviet military\n leaders were not eager to divert enormous resources\n into the research necessary for chemical weapons,\n and they were therefore requesting fu then intelli-\n gence assessments of the American chemical-warfare\n effort.\n Just at the time this intriguing intelligence was\n received, President Nixon was weighing the merits\n of a unilateral cutback in the production of chem-\n ical and biological weapons. The reports from Fedora\n and Tophat now suggested that (with the Soviet\n Union presumably far behind in development) the\n United States could gain a definite advantage by freez-\n ing chemical and biological weapons at their exist-\n ing levels. On November 9-5, 1969, President Nixon\n announced accordingly that the United States was\n ending production of these weapons in the hope that\n the Soviet Union would similarly stop its produc-\n tion. Shortly thereafter Fedora and Tophat report-\n ed to the FBI that the Soviet crash program had\n been abandoned. It was therefore assumed that the\n United States had retained its lead in these weapons.\n Four years later, when Israel captured Soviet\n tanks and other equipment in the Yom Kippur\n war, U.S. intelligence found that it had greatly un-\n derestimated the Soviet capacity for chemical war-\n fare. The captured weapons provided the first ac-\n tual evidence of the development and the state of\n the art of Soviet chemical weapons and defenses,\n and the analysis of this equipment showed that the\n United States was unquestionably behind lather\n than ahead of the Soviet Union in chemical war-\n fare. Moreover, by working backward from the state\n of manufacture of this equipment, it was further\n established that the Soviet Union had possessed this\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n\f Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n DISINFORMATION: OR, WHY THE CIA CANNOT VERIFY AN ARMS-CONTROL AGREEMENT/23\n technology-and thus a lead-before 1969. Evident-\n ly, then, the reports of Fedora and Tophat had\n been inaccurate-and possibly fraudulent.\n This and other developments led to a reassessment\n of the FBI's sources. The CIA had been suspicious\n of both Fedora and Tophat from the outset, and\n these disclosures reinforced its suspicions. And al-\n though FBI counterintelligence officials, such as As---\n sistant Director William Sullivan, also doubted the\n credentials of Fedora and Tophat, J. Edgar Hoover\n insisted on accepting their reports as bona-fide in-\n telligence. It was not until after Hoover's death,\n and a further reassessment, that the FBI admitted\n that both agents, who had by then returned to the\n Soviet Union, had actually been working under the\n control of the KGB and feeding the FBI misleading\n information.\n T HE practice of systematically channeling\n misleading information, such as that\n supplied by Fedora and Tophat, into an adversary's\n intelligence system for the purpose of warping its\n decision-making process is called \"disinformation.\"\n Although the concept is ancient, the term origi-\n nated with the German general staff when it created\n a \"disinformation service\" to mislead Germany's\n onpmioc in AATnrlri ZA7ar T  TTnli\n mation, which might be accidental and random, dis-\n information was the purposeful shaping of informa-\n tion to enhance the military strategy of the German\n general staff. While the German Disinformation\n Service restricted its scope of activities to sending\n misleading radio transmissions to the enemy, the\n purview of disinformation gradually expanded after\n the war.\n Soviet intelligence very quickly adopted the idea\n of \"dezinformatsiya\" to its own purposes and rede-\n fined it, as a recent KGB manual discloses, in the\n following terms: \"Strategic disinformation assists in\n the execution of state tasks and is directed at mis-\n leading the enemy concerning questions of state\n policy.\" As the manual makes abundantly clear,\n strategic disinformation is in both peacetime and\n wartime an instrument of Soviet policy. Just as\n Clausewitz defined war as the accomplishment of\n state policy by \"the sword in place of the pen,\" dis-\n information returns the accomplishment of state\n policy in Soviet doctrine to the pen-albeit a poi-\n soned one. And since strategic disinformation is in-\n separable from state policy, it is formulated at the\n highest level of the Kremlin.' Indeed, according to\n General Jan Sejna, who had served on the Central\n Committee in Czechoslovakia, and who defected in\n 1968: \"The Soviet Politburo approves the Ion-term\n global plan [for disinformation] for fifteen years\n and beyond.\"?\n Whereas strategic disinformation is part and par-\n cel of a \"political plan\" formulated by the Soviet\n Politburo, \"tactical disinformation\" is a mechanism\n designed and operated by the KGB itself to manip-\n ulate and control the adversary's interpretation of\n its own intelligence. Although there are numerous\n combinations and permutations available, the basic\n device for manipulation consists of a loop of com-\n munication channels connecting the KGB with the\n adversary's intelligence services. This loop requires\n an input channel, through which the disinformation\n messages are- fed to the adversary, and a feedback\n channel, through which the adversary's response and\n interpretation of these messages are fed to the de-\n ceiver.\n The input channels are relatively easy to or-\n ganize. At a rudimentary Ipvei, disinformation mes-\n sages can simply be put in the path of the adversary.\n Thus Soviet intelligence in the 1950's left disinfor-\n mation documents in embassy safes in Washington\n knowing that the FBI made a practice of burglariz-\n ing and photographing the contents.\n A more dependable channel for delivering mes-\n sages to the enemy is a double agent, such as\n Fedora, who pretends to cooperate with enemy in-\n tellience in order to win its confidence. At times,\n when the message is of sufficient import, an intelli-\n gence agent may even be dispatched to \"defect\"\n physically in order to add to the credibility of the\n disinformation. In addition to agents, electronic\n taps and \"bugs,\" or hidden microphones, can be\n are detected-and left in place. The effectiveness of\n such electronic channels will depend of course on\n the adversary's not realizing that its listening devices\n have been discovered.\n The establishment of the feedback in the loop is\n a far more difficult enterprise. It has generally re-\n quired penetrating the heart of the adversary's in-\n telligence system by either planting a \"mole\" in\n position where he learns and reports back inter-\n pretations of the disinformation, or by intercepting\n and breaking vital intelligence codes. However, now\n that computerized encryption has rendered code-\n breaking all but impossible, agents in place, or\n moles, have become the chief means of feedback in\n the deception loop.\n The KGB was able to maintain its Fedora-Top-\n ? Disinformation, Which aims at extending state policy,\n is a very different concept in Soviet doctrine from propa-\n ganda. Whereas disinformation aims at misleading an\n enemy government into making a disadvantageous decision,\n propaganda aims at misleading public opinion so that it\n resists the advantageous decisions of its government. The\n audience for disinformation is thus government decision-\n makers, and the prime channel for reaching this audience\n is through the intelligence service upon which they rely for\n their secret information. The data itself are usually secret\n and, as a recent CIA study notes, \"almost never receive\n public attention.\" Propaganda, on the other hand, is aimed\n at an audience of influential citizens. The main channel\n through which it reaches this audience is the media. By its\n very nature, propaganda involves public rather than secret\n knowledge.\n While there has recently been a tendency to use the\n more novel term \"disinformation\" to describe the manipu-\n lation of the media, the collapsing of the distinction be-\n tween disinformation and propaganda tends to confuse two\n very different sets of problems.\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n\f .

According to William ? Sullivan,\n without an inside source, the KGB could not have\n constantly modified Fedora's messages so that they\n conformed to the expectations of the FBI. While\n Sullivan had traced the putative mole to the New-\n YorY_ office, he was unable to single him out. \"At\n the time I left the FBI in 1971, the Russians still\n had a man in our office and none of us knew who\n he was,\" he noted in his memoirs.\n Feedback is an especially critical part of a con-\n tinuing deception. Without it, the success of disin-\n fg nation is problematic; with it, not only can the\n success of the deception be immediately ascertained\n but it can be. modified to accommodate any of its\n failings.\n L ENIN himself articulated the governing\n principle of Soviet disinformation in\n the early 1920's. When his first intelligence chief,\n Felix Dzerzhinsky, asked him what sort of disin-\n formation should be fed to the  'Vest, Lenin re-\n plied: \"Tell them what they want to believe.\"\n Lenin, who had a natural genius for such manip-\n ulations, realized the futility of using the disinfor-\n mation channels in an attempt to undermine the\n fierce anti-Communist beliefs of Western leaders.\n Instead, he recommended using these predisposi-\n tions to the Soviet Union's advantage by design-\n ing the disinformation around the theme that\n Communism was failing. Since Western leaders\n wanted to believe that the Communist experiment\n would soon collapse, there was a strong disposi-\n tion to accept the disinformation.\n Lenin provided a credible context for the secret\n disinformation campaign by declaring a New Eco-\n nomic Policy (or NEP) in which pure Commu-\n nism would be replaced by a mixed system of\n state socialism and private capitalism. He further\n invited foreign capitalists to the Soviet Union,\n and offered them concessions in mining and man-\n ufacturing that would replace failing Communist\n enterprises. Specifically, Lenin called in promi-\n nent Western businessmen and told them that\n Communism wasn't working in Russia.\n Meanwhile, on the covert side, Soviet intelli-\n gence organized a device for funneling disinfor-\n mation coinciding with this theme into the hands\n of Western intelligence services. This was a supposed-\n ly anti-Communist resistance group inside the Soviet\n Union called the \"Trust\"-a name not without\n irony since the sole purpose of the organization\n was to deceive those who trusted it. Representa-\n tives of the Trust contacted all the leading anti-\n Soviet organizations in exile in Europe and offered\n to help them steal Soviet secrets and arrange es-\n capes for their relatives and associates inside\n Russia. Since the Trust was in reality a creature\n of the Soviet intelligence service, it was easily able\n to deliver all the services it promised. It thus soon\n managed to convince these emigres groups that it\n represented a powerful anti-Communist force with\n agents infiltrated throughout the Soviet govern-\n ment.\n Once the Trust was accepted as credible, it began\n to parcel out pieces of secret information to the\n various anti-Communist groups which, in turn,\n sold the information to the Western intelligence\n services they were in contact with. Carefully or-\n chestrated by Soviet intelligence, these pieces of\n disinformation tended to dovetail with and con-\n firm each other. The main theme was that the\n Soviet government remained in power not because\n of the appeal of Communism, but because West-\n ern intervention had aroused Russian nationalism\n in support of the government. Presumably if for-\n eign intervention subsided, Soviet officials and\n army officers would themselves overthrow the\n Communist government.\n As Western governments came to accept this\n convenient thesis, they ceased planning troop\n landings, economic blockades, and less dramatic\n forms of harassment. Moreover, they dissuaded\n emigre groups based inside their borders from\n undertaking campaigns of sabotage and subver-\n sion within the Soviet Union, on the ground that\n such  acts  would hw c  iiic  uuiiiiuidcd  c rc t  va\n delaying the overthrow of the government.\n The Trust proved to be an enormous success\n as a channel for disinformation. Not only did it\n manage to quiet and anesthetize opposition to the\n Soviet Union by holding out the promise of an\n inside revolution; it also collected sums of money\n from nine Western intelligence services for the\n disinformation it provided which proved sufficient\n to finance the Trust itself as well as almost all the\n international activities of Soviet intelligence for\n six years.\n Finally, in 1927, after the end of the NEP and\n the nationalization of almost all foreign conces-\n sions, Soviet intelligence liquidated the Trust by\n sending a false defector to Helsinki to reveal that\n it had been a fraud from the beginning. This\n revelation served the purpose of further demoral-\n izing and confusing the anti-Soviet opposition.\n Deceptions like the Trust involve a remarkable\n degree of cooperation, albeit unwitting, between\n the deceived and the deceiver. Like a form of in-\n tellectual jiujitsu, the disinformation takes full\n advantage of the weight of an adversary's predis-\n positions in order to mislead it. If successfully de-\n ceived, an intelligence service views the messages\n it has received from the enemy as a triumphant\n coup, and it therefore can be expected to resist\n any subsequent efforts to debunk or discredit it\n (as the FBI later did for so long with Fedora and\n Tophat).\n W iTti the outbreak of World War II\n came a new reliance on intelligence\n -and its nemesis, disinformation.

In\n this sense, disinformation is analogous to cancer-\n ous cells which the body's immunological system\n cannot differentiate from healthy cells. The injec-\n tion of electronic disinformation managed, if\n nothing else, to paralyze and confuse the gather-\n ing of crucial military intelligence.\n Strategic deception was used by almost every\n participant in the war, with Britain and Germany\n each successful in manipulating and misleading\n adversaries through the use of controlled double\n agents and misleading radio transmissions.* As\n the war progressed, deception-planning staffs in\n Germany, England, America, and the Soviet\n Union were attached to the high command, and\n thereby became responsible for overall strategy.\n William R.

Harris writes: .\n Once deception planning was part of the stra-\n tegic planning process, the systematic targeting\n of an adversary's technical means of collection\n was inevitable. Unlike their counterparts in the\n field, the planners at the political centers had\n access to the most sensitive counterintelligence\n resources.  These  resources  included  access,\n through decryption of enemy ciphers, to key\n intelligence and decision-making channels. This\n feedback led deception planners to the target-\n ing of technical indicators, and especially those\n that were most credible to an adversary.\n Soviet intelligence in World War II lost little\n time in exploiting the technical capacity of its\n enemies to intercept Soviet communications. When\n it found that German intelligence had tapped\n into the cable links between the Soviet embassy'\n in Tokyo and Moscow, and had broken the diplo-\n matic ciphers, it neither closed down the tapped\n line nor switched to using the same kind of \"one-\n time\" codes which it used elsewhere (and were\n unbreakable). Instead, it turned the compromised\n communications to its own advantage by arrang-\n ing for its diplomats to transmit disinformation\n messages in the code that it knew full well had\n been broken. Feedback on German interpreta-\n tions of this Soviet disinformation was supplied\n by a group of moles who had been recruited in\n German intelligence-f\n In general, the Soviets proved extremely pro-\n ficient at this new species of disinformation. For\n example, in the summer of 1944, the Soviet de-\n ception staff managed through fake radio traffic\n and double-agents to persuade German intelli-\n gence that the Soviet offensive would come on the\n flanks in Finland and Rumania, and not in the\n center of the front in Byelorussia. Even though\n the Soviets amassed an army of 1,500,000 troops in\n Byelorussia, German intelligence was by this time\n so focused on the flanks that it failed to see this\n gigantic army. The Soviet offensive, which swept\n through an area the size of West Germany, caught\n the Germans totally by surprise.\n T HE wartime refinement of disinforma-\n tion provided Stalin with an extraordi-\n narily useful instrument for waging the cold war.\n Swords could again be replaced by poisoned pens.\n In the immediate postwar years, Soviet disinforma-\n tion focused on undermining American efforts to\n organize opposition to Soviet rule in Eastern Eur-\n ope. In 1951, for example, Soviet -intelligence or-\n ganized a fictitious underground \"army\" in Poland\n known by the acronym WIN (which stood in\n Polish for \"Freedom and Independence\"). Working\n through Polish exiiea ill Lulydtxl, WiN wui Lieu\n the CIA and British Intelligence (SIS) and repre-\n sented itself as a group commanding thousands of\n armed guerrillas in Poland. These claims were rein-\n forced by a number of double agents under Soviet\n control, and by interceptions of police and militia\n radio broadcasts in Poland, which seemed to con-\n firm that Soviet and Polish units were being\n harassed by guerrillas.\n Both the CIA and British SIS accepted WIN as\n a bona-fide anti-Communist \"army.\" Thus for\n more than a year, the CIA parachuted to WIN\n forces in Poland large caches of weapons, elec-\n tronic equipment, and gold bullion. It also put\n its own agents and Polish dissidents directly in\n touch with WIN commanders. In December 1952,\n after arresting all the agents and dissidents who\n had contacted WIN, Polish security forces an-\n nounced over the radio sufficient details about\n WIN to make it clear to the CIA that it had been\n duped by an intelligence fraud.\n The WIN deception achieved a double success:\n it lured virtually all the resistance groups inside\n *For the British deception that concealed the time,\n place, and purpose of the Normandy landings in 1944, see\n Anthony Cave Brown, Bodyguard of Lies (Harper & Row,\n 1976).

In the case of both the Trust decep-\n tion of the 1920's and the Polish Home Army de-\n ception in the late 1940's, the Soviet Union con-\n cealed its political strength (and capacity for\n repression) behind a mask of political weakness\n and internal strife. This theme was reversed in\n the 1950's, at least in the area of strategic wea-\n pons, when Soviet leaders began misrepresenting\n their weakness in intercontinental bombers and\n missiles as strength. Not only did Soviet intelli-\n gence attempt to mislead U.S. intelligence into\n overestimating Soviet bombers and missile capac-\n ity through the usual orchestration of double\n agents, leaks from Soviet scientists at conferences,\n and official statements; it also staged elaborate\n \"fly-bys\" of bombers at parades in which the same\n planes circled repeatedly over the reviewing stand\n in order to give an exaggerated impression of\n strength.\n During this period, Soviet intelligence also at-\n tempted to give the United States an impression\n of strength in its capacity to manufacture nuclear\n weapons. A German double agent, Heinz Felfe,\n actually under the control of the KGB, provided\n the CIA with a high-grade sample of uranium ore\n supposedly from mines in Czechoslovakia which led\n the CIA to revise upward its estimates of the num-\n ber of Soviet nuclear bombs. The Soviet projec-\n tion of intercontinental strength, which was char-\n acterized as the \"missile gap\" in the election of\n 1960, succeeded in making the threats and bluster\n of Khrushchev more credible. Moreover, by focus-\n ing the attention of U.S. intelligence on the inter-\n continental threat, the Soviets diverted attention\n from the rapid expansion of their medium-range\n bomber  and  missile  forces  that  were  de-\n ployed against Eurasian targets during this same\n period.\n A few years later, reversing the process once\n again to convey an impression of weakness, the\n Soviets misled the CIA into the belief that Soviet\n missiles-and especially the giant SS-9-lacked\n accurate guidance systems. From this it followed\n that these missiles were not a threat to our land-\n based ICBM force (the Minuteman complexes),\n and thus there was no need to disperse or reinforce\n the silos, or to attempt to develop an antiballistic\n missile. Given these assumptions about the relative\n inaccuracy of the Soviet guidance system, Secretary\n of Defense McNamara concluded, as he testified\n in 1963:\n It is clear that the Soviets do not have anything\n like the number of missiles necessary to knock\n out our Minuteman force, nor do they appear\n to have any present plans to acquire such a\n capacity. If they were to undertake the con-\n struction, and deployment of a large number of\n high-yield missiles, we would probably have\n knowledge of this and would have ample time\n to expand our Minuteman force, or to disperse\n it more widely.\n As it turned out, McNamara, along with the\n entire American strategic establishtuent, was dead\n wrong. Without \"knowledge\" by U.S. intelligence,\n the Soviet Union did proceed to deploy 'a highly\n accurate force that threatened to overwhelm the\n Minuteman deterrent. How could U.S. intelli-\n gence, with all its satellites, electronic sensors, and\n other resources, have been led into missing or\n misinterpreting such a massive development in\n Soviet missile technology?\n Albert Wohlstetter has suggested that the CIA\n estimators tended to shape ambiguities in their data\n toward a preconceived theory they held about So-\n viet strategy, and the pressure toward \"conformity\"\n and \"consensus\" overrode hostile evidence. Such\n self-deception on the part of the CIA analysts does\n not, however, preclude the possibility of their hav-\n ing been misled by disinformation. Indeed, when a\n feedback channel exists, preconceptions are an im-\n portant ingredient in the perpetration of an intelli-\n gence fraud (\"Tell them what they want to be-\n lieve\"). And there were at least two such feedback\n channels in the early 60's, in the form of moles who\n were eventually identified.\n One was Jack E. Dunlap, employed at the head-\n quarters of the super-secret National Security Agency\n (NSA) as an analyst with top-secret clearance and\n also as the chauffeur for its chief-of-staff, Major\n General Garrison B. Coverdale. In this latter capac-\n ity, he was permitted to drive one of the few \"no-\n inspection\" cars off the closely ,guarded base which\n he used to smuggle out vast quantities of secret doc-\n uments,- including some that concerned the moni-\n toring of Soviet missile testing. After the leak was\n discovered in 1963, Dunlap committed suicide.\n Soviet intelligence also had an unparalleled chan-\n nel of feedback at the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in\n the person of Colonel William Whalen. Colonel\n Whalen, who had been recruited by Soviet intelli-\n gence in the late 1950's when lie was serving as a\n military liaison officer, was the intelligence adviser\n to the Army Chief of Staff, and in this capacity he\n had a legitimate \"need to know\" on virtually any\n question concerning U.S. (or Soviet) intelligence.\n He could thus tap the combined intelligence re-\n sources of the CIA, FBI, and NSA, as well as mili-\n tary intelligence, on any matter of presumed inter-\n est to the joint Chiefs of Staff. Up until his detec-\n tion and arrest in 1963, lie supplied whatever infor-\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n\f Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n DISINFORMATION: OR, WHY THE CIA CANNOT VERIFY AN ARMS-CONTROL AGREEMENT/27\n mation the KGB required concerning American\n interpretation of intelligence information inter-\n cepted from the Soviet Union. With this in hand,\n the KGB could constantly adjust and modify its\n stream of disinformation.\n In short, since the intelligence establishment was\n basing its estimates of the accuracy of Soviet guid-.\n ante systems on data intercepted from Soviet trans-\n mitters, which the Soviets knew were being mon-\n itored, and on reports from double agents under\n KGB control, self-deception could only have been\n one element of a well-executed scheme of disinfor-\n mation.\n To be sure, vital pieces of the puzzle were un-\n available until the early 1970's when new and\n better methods were developed of photographing\n and analyzing the craters caused by the impact of\n Soviet warheads. These revealed a profound dis-\n crepancy between the estimates of missile accuracy\n garnered from the interception of Soviet telemetry\n and the actual degree of accuracy as measured by\n this  new  photoreconnaissance method.  There\n could be no doubt that American intelligence\n had been misled by disinformation.\n AT THE root of the entire problem was\n A. ,   Y  .1111411  ~a1-.11.\\,  lllal~  111~.OJ Ul~.4 r aV1l~\n called an accelerometer. Soviet missiles carried three\n accelerometers, and it had been assumed that these\n devices performed the critically important task of\n determining the exact position of the missile in\n flight. If these accelerometers were even a shade in-\n accurate, the missile could not accurately hit its\n target. Since the CIA was able to intercept the sig-\n nals from these accelerometers during tests through\n its ground antennas in Iran and Pakistan, it believed\n that it had a constant indicator of accuracy. Al-\n though the CIA presumed that Soviet intelligence\n was aware that its telemetry was being intercepted,\n it also assumed that these vital data could not be\n falsified because they were needed for guiding the\n missile.\n Reassessments by the RAND Corporation and\n other highly specialized think tanks under contract\n to the CIA and the Department of Defense showed,\n however, that since the three accelerometers pro-\n vided redundant instrumentation, it was technically\n possible for the Soviets deliberately to distort the\n data from one accelerometer without losing the\n ability to monitor the missile test accurately. In-\n deed, a reanalysis of the telemetry data seemed to\n indicate just such a \"systematic bias\"-or disinfor-\n mation. After studying this telemetry problem,\n William Harris of RAND testified before the\n Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He con-\n cluded:\n With an understanding of the technical indica-\n tors and methods of U.S. estimation of ballistic\n missile accuracy, the Soviets managed to under-\n represent the accuracy of intercontinental ballis-\n tic missiles.... Only systematic biasing of tech-\n nical indicators would produce the apparently\n large errors in guidance... .\n The \"technical indicators\" he referred to were of\n course the telemetry from the on-board acceler-\n ometers. Assuming that the Soviets realized that we\n were underestimating their missile accuracy-and\n there was sufficient feedback from public as well as\n intelligence sources during this period-the con-\n tinued biasing of the telemetry could only have\n been disinformation.\n In addition to thus \"double-crossing\" our elec-\n tronic devices, the Soviets, through the activities of\n double agents under KGB control in the U.S., kept\n the attention of U.S. intelligence focused on the ac-\n celerometers. Fedora, for example, told the FBI\n that the Soviet Union was having severe problems\n constructing missile-guidance systems. Then, in the\n mid-60's, he reported to the FBI that the KGB had\n been assigned the task of buying an accelerometer\n from an American company. As he was responsible\n for stealing secrets on scientific and missile develop-\n ments, this KGB request came under his purview. A\n few weeks later, a Soviet employee at the UN\n named Vadim Isakov visited a dealer in surplus gov-\n ernment equipment in Paterson, New Jersey; pro-\n ducing a shopping list, he offered to buy a $6,000\n accelerometer made by the American Bosch Arma\n Company, a miniature computer, and a titanium\n pressure vehicle-devices that were all necessary to\n missile guidance. The FBI, which had the entire\n Soviet buying mission under surveillance, found\n that Isakov seemed \"Particularly anxious about the\n accelerometers. Fedora meanwhile was asked by the\n FBI to inquire into the need for this special equip-\n ment on a trip he was making to Moscow. When he\n returned to New York, he told the FBI the equip-\n ment was needed because of a failure in the Soviet\n missile program.               -\n The pieces fit neatly together, and the FBI liaison\n duly passed on the evidence of the Soviet missile\n failure to the CIA's Directorate of Science and\n Technology which found that it dovetailed with\n the analysis of the telemetry intercepts. Different\n channels of secret information thus seemed to cor-\n roborate one another:\n It was not until late 1974 that the CIA began an\n agonizing examination of the possibility that its satel-\n lites and antennas were being \"double-crossed\" by\n Soviet disinformation. A special \"reading room\" for\n this super-secret data was set up for CIA counter-\n intelligence specialists at the Directorate of Science\n and Technology. Before the problem could be even\n initially explored, the entire counterintelligence\n staff was shaken up-and most of its key members\n forcibly retired-in the wake of the firing (for other\n reasons) of its chief, James Angleton, in December\n 1974.\n ISINrORMATION, then, emerges as the\n D only plausible explanation of how the\n Soviets achieved a strategic breakout of the missile\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049RO01102720030-1\n\f Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049R001102720030-1\n 28/COMMENTARY JULY 1982\n stalemate. The problem for the Soviet Union in the\n early 60's was to increase its vulnerable and numeri-\n cally inferior missile force to a threatening level-\n without provoking the United States similarly to\n increase, or defend, its existing missile force. More-\n over, the Soviet Union had to effect this build-up at\n a time when all its silo-construction and missile=\n testing programs were being closely monitored by\n the cameras and sensors of U.S. spy satellites. It was\n able to accomplish this seemingly impossible task\n because U.S. intelligence gravely underestimated the\n truly threatening aspect of the Soviet missiles-their\n potential for accuracy-on the basis of intercepted\n test data and the reports of double agents that had\n been deliberately falsified and that played into pre-\n conceptioris about the Soviet Union's technological\n capacity.\n The likelihood that such a deception could have\n been detected in a contemporaneous time frame\n seems remote. Disinformations that mimic prevail-\n ing preconceptions contain their own camouflage.\n Moreover, as we have seen, such deceptions rapidly\n become entangled and fused with the bureaucratic\n interests of the intelligence services themselves, and\n any effort to attack them becomes perceived as an\n attack on the intelligence service itself. For exam-\n ple, to ferret out evidence of the missile deception,\n it would have been necessary to call into question\n the credibility of such highly productive sources as\n the satellites, antennas, and the moles working with-\n in Soviet intelligence. Most career officers who tried\n to do this found their careers at an end.\n THUS, while Congress and the informed public\n have been under the impression that satellites and\n electronic wizardry can be relied upon for foolproof\n intelligence, the story of the misestimates of Soviet\n missile accuracy demonstrates that these \"national\n technical means\" are at least as susceptible to Soviet\n deception as less exotic means of intelligence-gather-\n ing. The persistent denial of the problem of disin-\n formation serves only to increase its chances of suc-\n cess. And without a radical reorganization of the\n kind that is opposed by the CIA bureaucracy, it is\n unlikely that any effective measures can be taken to\n prevent our intelligence services and ultimately our\n national leaders from being \"double-crossed\" again.\n Their continuing vulnerability to Soviet disinfor-\n mation casts the most serious doubt on whether\n \"national technical means\" can ever be sufficient to\n verify Soviet compliance with any new arms-control\n agreement.\n Approved For Release 2007/06/25: CIA-RDP84B00049R001102720030-1"

There has been a disin-\n formation program that is virtually,\n worldwide, and we know that the Sovi-\n ets and Cubans have such a disinforma-\n tion network that is beyond anything\n we can match.\"\n Reagan was taking his administra-\n tion's fascination with disinformation\n -the covert planting of forgeries or\n bum dope-out of the familiar context\n of Third  World and European vu ner-\n bility to Soviet wiles. He was sug-\n gesting, as heard him, that in respect\n to Nicaragua American opinion is\n being manipulated: Americans aren't\n :xolanations of their govern-\n ment's policy and some of them are\n returning from trips to Nicaragua with\n \"views that are favorable to that to-\n talitarian government.\"\n Did the president really intend to\n present the dispute over the contras\n not as a political matter on which rea-\n sonable people can disagree-which\n surely it is-but as an instance in\n which the raggedy Sandinistas, even\n by piggybacking on hefty Havana and\n mighty Moscow, could have duped the\n American public and Congress by a\n successful disinformation campaign?\n The disinformation theme has be-\n come a staple in an administration\n whose leading lights accept easily both\n the idea of a multi-tentacled Soviet\n global conspiracy and the companion no-\n tion that the American press is riddled\n with impressionable soft-liners and polit-\n ical enemies. References to disinforma-\n tion adorn the statements of high offi-\n cials.

He introduced it\n is follows:\n MR. PRICE. Mr. Speaker, a major program to defame and\n discredit U.S. departments and agencies having responsibilities for\n national security has been conducted by the Soviet and\n Communist bloc since 1948. How it operates is explained in a\n paper, \"The Soviet and Communist Bloc Defamation Campaign,\"\n which I submit for printing in the RECORD. Main targets are the\n Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of\n Investigation.\n The paper follows:\n 1. The Soviet and Communist bloc effort to defame and\n discredit U.S. departments and agencies that have major\n responsibilities for national security has been underway since\n 1948. A major program is aimed at the Central Intelligence\n Agency and has grown markedly in quantity and intensity since\n the establishment of the KGB Department of Disinformation in\n 1959. This . program now produces between 350 and 400\n derogatory items annually. Communist press and radio.' attacks\n against the Agency reveal an Increased sophistication in recent\n years. In addition, many Communist-inspired books and\n pamphlets which attack the existence, purposes, and status of\n CIA, and reflect a substantial budget for this activity, have\n ? appeared throughout southeast Asia, Africa, and the Near East.\n 2. CIA, in its intelligence role, is feared by the Soviets for its\n responsibility. and ability to penetrate and unmask Communist\n conspiracies against democratic institutions. By striking at CIA,\n the attack also centers on the intelligence community with\n particular thrust against the FBI and Mr. J. Edgar Hoover. The\n objective of the overall program is to achieve the destruction,,\n break-up, and neutralization of CIA. A basic requirement o#'\n Soviet policy and a major objective of the Soviet intelligence\n service is the destruction of effective security collaboration\n among the non-Communist countries in order to carry out Soviet\n long-term strategic plans for subversion, political upheavals,\n popular fronts,  d the eventual political isolation of the United\n States.\n 3. Defamation and forgery operations are conceived, directed,\n and perpetrated by a single organization located outside the\n target areas which makes use of local Communist: or\n pro-Communist propagandists and of all operating Communist\n bloc intelligence and security services. Although such\n undertakings are the products of the disinformation department\n of the KGB, known as department D, which is headed by Gen.\n Ivan Ivanovich Agayants, they are reviewed and passed on by the\n Soviet leadership. The operations of the Soviet Disinformation\n Department have been successful thus far in stimulating a wide\n replay in Africa, southeast Asia, the Middle East, and even in the\n United States. CIA will continue to be the prime target of Soviet\n 4. It is an established Soviet principle now embraced by all\n members of the Communist bloc - that a large percentage of\n subversive activity be devoted to the planning and conduct of\n disinformation (dezinformatsiya) operations which mold, divide,\n and mislead other governments or leaders and cause them to\n adopt policies and undertakings which are ultimately\n advantageous only to the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership has\n charged the Soviet State Security Service, the KGB, to place very\n great emphasis, both organizationally and operationally, on\n disinformation activity. Communist bloc. services, in turn, are\n playing their part in this work.\n 5. What are disinformation operations? \"Dezinform'atsiya,\"in\n Soviet terminology is false, incomplete, or misleading information\n that is passed, fed, or confirmed to a targetted individual, group,;\n or country. \"Propaganda,\" as it is defined by free world students,\n may be used as a support.. element of dezinformatsiya, but\n propaganda per se lacks the precision and bite of disinformation.\n 6. Soviet disinformation activity is planned and directed by\n specialized department of the Soviet State Security Service. This\n KGB department, which was created to intensify Soviet\n disinformation activity, is headed by Gen. Ivan Ivanovich\n Approved For Release 2005/01/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R0004.0042Q010-4\n\f 4 prggve-d .or Release 20Dh5/?1/13\n Agayants, a senior, pro   h m  inte ligence o icer wit  ong\n experience and well-developed agent and political contacts in\n Western Europe, especially in France. where he served under the\n name Ivan Ivanovich Avalov. At one time In France he controlled\n the French spy Georges Pasques who was sentenced to life\n imprisonment on July 7. 1964.\n 7. The assignment of Agayants to take over the disinformation\n task indicates the high priority that the then Chairman of the\n Presidium, Nikita Khrushchev, gave to the campaign against\n American leadership and activity. Chairman Kosygin and First\n Secretary Brezhnev have made no changes in that program.\n Department D is still directly tied Into the Presidium in the\n planning of its work.\n 8. Agayants department is staffed by an estimated 40 to 50\n geographical and functional specialists in Moscow alone; It avails\n itself directly and peremptorily of the worldwide resources,\n manpower and operations, of the Soviet security apparatus. The\n purposes, broadly stated, of the disinformation department are\n (a) Destroy the confidence of the Congress and the American\n public in U.S. personnel and agencies engaged in anti-Communist\n and cold war activity.\n (b) Undermine American prestige and democratic Institutions\n and denigrate American leadership with NATO governments and\n other non-Communist countries, thereby contributing directly to\n the breakup of the NATO alliance.\n (c) Sow distrust and create grounds for subversion and revolt\n against the United States in the Western Hemisphere and among\n the new nations of Africa and Asia.\n These purposes and objectives, it must be emphasized, have\n been established by the highest elements of party and government\n in the Soviet Union.\n 9. Personal experiences with this program have been described\n by officers who have left the Soviet system and are now in the\n United States. One of these - Alexander Kaznacheev, who served\n in Burma as an information officer - described the program and\n the process in a recent personal memoir:\n \"Articles were originated in KGB headquarters in Moscow -\n for example, about alleged American support of the Indonesian\n rebels, frequent American violations of Cambodia' sovereignty,\n subversive activity of Japan in the region, etc. The articles were\n received from Moscow on microfilm and reproduced as enlarged\n photo-copies at the Embassy. It was my job to translate them\n into English. Some other members of Vozny's group would then\n arrange through local agents for the articles to. be placed in one of\n the Burmese newspapers, usually pro-Communist-oriented. The\n newspaper would translate the article into Burmese, make slight\n changes in style, and sign it from \"Our special correspondent in\n Singapore,\" for instance. Upon publication of such an article, the\n illegitimate creation of Soviet Intelligence receives an appearance\n of legitimacy and becomes a sort of document.\n \"But the work was not yet finished. I then took the published\n article and checked it against the original Russian text. I noted all\n the changes and variations made by the newspaper, and wrote\n down in Russian the fatal version of the article. This final version\n was then immediately sent back to Moscow, this time through\n Tass channels.\n \"The last stage of this grandiose forgery was under the special\n care of the Soviet Information Bureau, Tass, Radio-Moscow, the\n Soviet press, and Soviet diplomatic representatives abroad. It Is\n their duty to see that the material is republished and distributed\n in all countries of the region as if they were genuine documents\n which had appeared In the Burmese press.\" -\n CIA-RDP88-0131   %Q0401042( 000 -4\n 10. Althou  the     xs a e to acate in Moscow ;fiatevet\n material is needed for its disinformation operations, it has been\n making more and more use of material published in the West,\n some of which had been planted there by earlier disinformation\n activities. An examination of the books and articles cited in any\n of the anti-CIA pamphlets reveals extensive use of Western source\n material, often taken out of context. The most recent Soviet\n articles on the Agency are exclusively \"documented\" from\n Western books, articles, and newspapers.\n 11. In the 58 pages of \"CIA Over Asia,\" a slanderous booklet\n published in Kanpur, India, in 1962, for example, American\n newspapers and magazines are cited 11 times, periodicals of other\n Western or neutral countries 15 times. The fact that some\n references are made to Communist organs is obscured by repeated\n citations from reputable American publications.\n 12. A study of Soviet disinformation shows thatthe Soviets\n are engaged in an Impressive research project to collect and\n process information and speculation about American intelligence\n and security services that appear in Western publications and\n newspapers.. This study also has confirmed the deep interest of\n the Soviet services In the development and milking of Western\n journalists; Americans figure prominently among these.    .\n 13. The measure and depth of department D's activity against\n the CIA may be judged from a single episode. A booklet attacking\n the former Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. Allen W. Dulles,,\n entitled 'A Study of a Master Spy\" (Allen Dulles), was printed\n and distributed in London during 1961, and has since becn\n reprinted. The ostensible author was a prominent maverick I.aboi- -\n Member of Parliament, one Bob Edwards, who was supposedly\n assisted in the effort by a British journalist. It is now known that\n the manuscript was researched in Moscow by a senior KGD\n disinformation officer, Col. Vassily Sitnikov, and then served up.\n for final polish and printing in the United Kingdom. Mr. Duties\n himself discussed this episode on a TV roundtable on March 29,\n 1964:\n \"MR. HANSON BALDWIN. Well, that brings up, too, doesn't\n It, the question of disinformation? What kind of disinformation is\n being distributed by the Soviets today? Can you explain this,\n Allen?                           ..    .\n \"MR. DULLES. Well, I have here right in my hand -\n \"MR. BALDWIN. And what is disinformation, anyway?\n \"MR. DULLES. Well, this is it. Here's 'A Study of a Master\n Spy.' Here's a booklet that was written about me. Now, it bears\n on the outside hers, you see, 'A Study of a Master Spy.' i won't\n give you the names of the authors, but one of them Is a tnember-\n -\n of the legislature of a very great, friendly country. But the real\n author of this - I am the 'master spy' -- I have found out\n recently after certain research had bee-a done, that the real author\n of this pamphlet is a Colonel Sitnikov, whom I believe you know,\n or know of. He is the real author.    -\n \"MIt. DERYABIN. Sitnikov? I used to work with Sitnikoti' in\n Vienna when he was deputy chief of the Soviet spy force, and he\n was the chief of an American desk, I mean, working against\n Americans. He was trained as an intelligence officer. One time he  .\n was a spy chief in Berlin and Potsdam, another time he was in\n Vienna. To my knowledge last time he was in Bonn as a counselor\n to the Embassy, but I mentioned him in my book and in the\n articles in Life in 1959, and it is my belief that he is at home\n \"MR.. DULLES. He has a whole dossier on me. I've read some-\n things there about myself that even I didn't know.\"\n CONTINUING ATTACK ON THE DCI\n 14. The resignation of Mr. Alien Dulles and the appointment\n Approved For Release 2005/01/13: CIA-RDP88-01315RO00400420010=4    ..     :=\n\f Approved For Release 2005/01/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400420010-4\n Df Mr. John McCone necessitated a shift in the Communist attack\n :)n the Director of Central Intelligence. The Soviet propaganda\n transition from one Director of Central Intelligence to another\n was accomplished by June 1963 with the publication of a\n pamphlet entitled, \"Spy No. I.\" Issued by the State Publishing\n House of Political Literature in Moscow (June 1963), the\n substance of the book is summarized on the title page:\n \"John Alex McCone is the Director of the Central Intelligence\n Agency of the United States. Behind the exterior of a respectable\n gentleman is hidden the seasoned spy, the organizer of dirty\n political intrigues and criminal conspiracies.\n \"This pamphlet tells of the past of the chief of American\n intelligence, of the methods by which he amassed his millions and\n became the servant of the uncrowned kings of America, the\n Rockefellers, and of the influence which McCone exerts on the\n policies of the U.S. Government, particularly in the Cuban\n affair.\"\n 15. In November 1964, the Soviet newspaper Komsomol'skaya\n .Pravda published a further attack on Mr. McCone entitled, \"Ibe\n Spy With the Slide Rule.\" Referring to. Mr. McCone's activities as\n Director of CIA, the article added, \"Under the leadership of\n McCone, the CIA was transformed from just an invisible\n government to a government of U.S. oil monopolies, mainly\n Standard Oil and its owners, the Rockefeller group. All of the.\n military adventures in Lebanon, in southeast Asia, Aden, and\n Brazil, were carried out with the participation of emissaries of the\n man with the slide rule.\"\n 16. On December 8, 1964, Moscow domestic radio stated:\n \"The American newspaper New York Herald Tribune had\n reported that:\n \"U.S. Central Intelligence Agency boss John McCone has\n secretly approached President Johnson with a resignation\n request ... the American press prefers for the moment not to\n speak about the actual reason for McCone's resignation. The\n reason for it consists, in the first instance, in the serious collapse\n of American foreign policy, which, to a considerable degree, is\n formulated on the data provided by the CIA. Basing its activity\n on defense of the interests of the largest monopolistic groups .\n based on the ideology of anticommunism and militarism, the CIA\n is proving incapable of a more or less objective, correct appraisal\n of the balance of power in the world arena. ... The American\n journalists, David White (sic) and Thomas Ross, drawing attention\n to the subversive activity of the CIA, just call it, `The Invisible\n Government .... There is a basis to suspect,' White and Ross\n write, `that frequently the foreign policy of the United States as\n made public in the speeches of the State officials, acts in one\n direction, while secretly, through \"The Invisible Government,' it\n acts in the opposite direction.\"\n 17. President Johnson's appointment of Adm. William F.\n Raborn on April 11, 1965 gave the Soviet press another\n opportunity to review and renew its attack on the Director of\n Central Intelligence. Moscow domestic radio announced the next\n day that the appointment signified \"the further strengthening of\n cooperation between the espionage apparatus and the military\n and military industrial monopolies.\"\n 18. An editorial published on April 14, 1965 in the Tanzanian\n newspaper, the Nationalist, which was replayed by the New China\n News Agency, claimed that Admiral Raborn's 'appointment\n implied an \"attempt to save the face of the United States over\n accusations of interference in the internal affairs of newly\n independent states in particular..\"\n 19. Krasnaya Zvezda in Moscow asserted (April 18, 1965) that\n the departure of Mr. McCone and General Marshall S. Carter was\n \"connected with new failures in assessing those forces against\n which American imperialism is aiming its aggressive blows.\" The\n article concluded, \"The American imperialists probably assume\n that Raborn will be a more successful accomplice for them in the\n struggle against the peoples of the socialist countries and other\n freedom-loving peoples. These hopes are hardly justified,\n however, since in our era the course of historical events is not\n being determined by -the Raborns and not even by their Wall\n Street bosses.\"\n 20. On June 5, 1965, the Greek Communist newspaper Avgh1,\n in an article entitled, \"U.S. Master Spy, William Raborn,\" alleged\n that the appointment of Admiral Raborn was intended \"to lessen\n the enmity between the CIA and the Defense Department\n Intelligence Service.\" The article continued, \"The main reason is\n the fact that.the key posts in the American. administration are\n now being taken over by representatives of the top and overt\n forms of monopolist capital, the most reactionary force that leans\n toward dangerous adventurism. At least that is what the events hi\n Indochina, Dominican Republic, Congo, and elsewhere show.\"\n THE COMMUNIST CHARGES AGAINST CIA\n 21. The themes exploited by the campaign of the Communist\n bloc against CIA, its Director, and its operations have remained.\n generally the same since the beginning of the attack. Nevertheless,\n slants. and replays have been constantly adjusted to changing\n world and regional political developments and to the\n vulnerabilities of target audiences and individuals, particularly in\n the newly emerging areas. The basic anti-CIA themes in use as of\n midsummer 1965 are:\n (a) CIA is an instrument of American Imperialism. It is racist,\n and a direct threat to national liberation movements. -\n (b) In its work against national liberation movements, CIA\n engages in espionage, economic and political subversion, sabotage,\n assassination and terrorism; it trains and supports\n counter-revolutionary forces.\n (c) CIA is an instrument of American aggression and gathers\n intelligence for aggressive plans against peace-loving socialist\n states. Diplomats, tourists, and scientists are used by CIA for\n these purposes.\n (d) CIA dominates and generates American foreign policy\n (e) CIA engages in psychological warfare, utilizing falsehoods\n to undermine the international authority of the U.S.S.R.\n (f) CIA is fighting the Communist Party of the U.S.A., and the\n Communist and Worker Parties of other capitalist countries.\n (g) CIA spies on the allies of the United States and overthrows\n its henchmen who are unable to suppress national liberation\n movements.\n 22. The increasing weight of the attack on CIA becomes\n evident when an examination is made of the periodicals,\n International Affairs, New Times, and Kommunist, all three of\n which are issued in Moscow, the first two in English and other\n languages. International Affairs carried one major article on\n American intelligence in 1960,and another in 1962. Since March\n 1964, there have been five articles devoted to that theme. These\n articles have alleged in general that intelligence controls U.S.\n foreign policy and big business controls intelligence. The New\n 77mes published one article on CIA in 1961, and one in 1963.\n Three articles concerning CIA were published by this\n Approved For Release 2005/01/13: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400420010-4:,-\n\f Approved For Release 2005/01/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400420010-4\n multilingual magazine during 1964. In May 1965, Kommunist\n published an article with the title, \"The American Intelligence\n Service Is a Weapon of Adventurism and Provocation.\"\n 23. The assassination of President Kennedy was the subject of\n a book by Joachim Joesten entitled, \"Oswald - Assassin or Fall\n Guy?\" (1964) published by Marzani and Munsell Publishers, inc.\n of New York, in which Joesten states that there is no question in\n his mind that Oswald was a minor CIA agent. Marzani, a known\n Communist, was coauthor of a pamphlet, \"Cuba Vs. CIA.\"\n published in 1961. Joesten is revealed In a German Security\n Police memorandum, dated November 8, 1937, to have been an\n active member of the German Communist Party (KPD) since May\n 12, 1932; he was issued Communist Party membership card\n (Mitgliedsbuch) No. 532315.\n 24. A primary aim of Soviet disinformation is to sow distrust\n among the Western allies by discrediting the policies and motives\n of the United States and American methods of implementing\n those policies. Considerable attention is devoted to creating\n apprehension, uncertainty, and antagonism toward the United\n States among the uncommitted and underdeveloped nations.\n Thus, the Soviets reiterate the longstanding Communist charge\n that the United States is imperialistic and seeks world\n domination. They continually emphasize the theme that CIA is a\n major instrument in the execution of American policy. Two\n pamphlets; \"CIA Over Asia\" (Kanpur, 1962) and \"America's\n Undeclared War\" (Bombay, 1963), are dedicated to this theme.\n 25. An example of the use of the daily press and radio to\n mount this line of attack occurred 2 years ago in Ghana.\n Sufficient time has now passed to permit an evaluation of the\n episode. In late February and March 1963, CIA was subjected to\n an attack in the Ghana press and radio which attempted to tie the\n Agency to the death of Premier Qassim of Iraq. This campaign\n was allegedly based on an article in the French paper L'Express\n which asserted that CIA was the \"author of the Iraq murder.\" An\n article in the Ghana Evening News for February In 1963 was\n headlined \"Neo-Colonist Terror in Iraq Menacing Threat Against\n Africa.\" On May 15, 1965, the Spark, a weekly Ghanian\n newspaper, carried a front page story with the headline \"The\n Secret War of CIA, The Killer at Your Door.\" According to the\n article, \"This murderous game, which goes by the\n innocent-sounding name of \"Intelligence', has its Western-world\n nerve-center in America's Central Intelligence Agency, known\n briefly as CIA.\" Included in the article were eight illustrations of\n .Approved-For Release 2005/01/13 .' CIA-RDP88-013'15RO-004Q0420010-4\n \"spy equipment.\" Four of these illustrations had earlier appeaied\n In West Berlin - The Facts, an anti-CIA tract that was published\n in Moscow in 1962.                        -\n 26. A major theme developed principally in the uncommitted\n areas during the past 12 to 18 months has been the alleged\n interference of the United States, and especially CIA, in the\n internal affairs of other countries. Three recent pamphlets,\n \"American Intelligence - This is Your Enemy\" (Cairo, April\n 1964), \"The Truth About Komia Gbedemah\" (Ghana, October\n 1964), and \"Operation Boa Constrictor\" (Colombo, 1964)\n develop the idea that through its intelligence and aid agencies, the\n United States is engaged in a conspiracy to dominate the Middle\n East, Africa, and Asia. The conspiracy allegedly takes the form of\n active efforts to overthrow anti-American governments and to\n gain econgmlc control of these areas through foreign aid and\n economic exploitation.\n SOVIET FORGERIES\n 27. One of the preferred instruments utilized by the Soviets to-\n disseminate disinformation is the forged document. Detailed\n testimony on 32 U.S. forgeries attributable to the Communis'\n bloc was given by Mr. Richard Helms of CIA on June 2, 1961,\n before the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Sena?c.\n Committee on the Judiciary. Fourteen new instances of forged\n U.S. official documents have come under scrutiny by the cad of\n July 1965. Some of the more recent examples are still being\n studied. Although CIA has not been omitted from some of then\n spurious documents, the principal purpose of such forgeries h:.\n been to discredit U.S. policies and the representatives of otht\n U.S. agencies overseas, such as the Department of State, USIA,\n the Peace Corps, the Armed Forces of the United States and\n American political leaders generally.\n 28. The Soviet defamation campaign, whatever may be its\n targets, has but one objective. Defamation of the CIA is only an\n aspect of a coherent, well-orchestrated effort to denigrate the-\n United States and its policies before world opinion. Every\n department and agency of the U.S. Government is a potential\n target of the disinformation department when such attacks wilt\n serve Soviet interests. Whatever may be. the immediate subject of\n any single Soviet disinformation operation - CIA, the State\n Department, the Peace Corps, or USIA, the ultimate objective is\n to isolate and destroy what the KGB designates as \"Gland Vrag\"\n (\"Main Enemy'), the United States.

The Soviet and Communist Bloc effort to defame and\n discredit U.S. departments and agencies that have major\n responsibilities for national security has been underway since\n 1948.  A major program is aimed at the Central Intelligence\n Agency and has grown markedly in quantity and intensity since.\n the establishment of the KGB Department of Disinformation in\n 1959.  This program now produces between 350 and 400 derogatory\n items annually.  Communist press and radio attacks against the\n Agency reveal an increased, sophistication in recent years.  In-\n addition, many Communist-inspired books and pamphlets which\n attack the existence, purposes and status of CIA, and reflect a\n substantial budget for this activity, have appeared throughoLt\n Southeast Asia, Africa and the Near East.\n 2.  CIA, in its intelligence role, is feared by the Soviets\n for its responsibility and ability to penetrate and unmask\n Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R000500010047-7\n\f Approved For.Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1.676R000500010047-7\n Communist conspiracies against democratic institutions.  By\n striking at CIA, the attack also centers on the Intelligence\n Community with particular thrust against the FBI and Mr. J.\n Edgar Hoover.  The objective of the overall program is to achieve\n the destruction, break-up and neutralization of CIA.  A basic\n requirement of Soviet policy and a major objective of the Soviet\n Intelligence Services is the destruction of effective security\n collaboration among the non-Communist countries in order to\n carry out Soviet long-term strategic plans for subversion, political\n upheavals, popular fronts and the eventual political isolation of the\n United States.\n 3.  Defamation and forgery operations are conceived,\n directed and perpetrated by a single organization located outside\n the target areas which makes use of local Communist or pro-\n Communist propagandists and of cooperating Communist Bloc\n intelligence and security services.  Although such undertakings\n are the products of the Disinformation Department of the KGB,\n known as Department \"D \",   which is headed by General Ivan\n Ivanovich Agayants, they are reviewed and passed on by the\n Soviet leadership.

It is an established Soviet principle -- now embraced\n by all members of the Communist Bloc -- that a large percentage\n of subversive activity be devoted to the planning and conduct of\n disinformation (dezinformatsiya) operations which mold, divide,\n and mislead other governments or leaders, and cause them to\n adopt policies and undertakings which are ultimately advantageous\n only to the Soviet Union,  The Soviet leadership has charged\n the Soviet State Security Service., the KGB, to place very great\n emphasis, both organizationally and operationally, on disinformation\n activity,  Communist Bloc services, in turn, are playing their part\n in this work.\n 5.    What are disinformation operations?  \"Dezinformatsiya\",\n in Soviet terminology, is false, incomplete or misleading infor-\n mation that is passed, fed or confirmed to a targetted individual,\n group, or country,  \"Pr-opaganda\", as it is defined by Free World\n students, may be used as a support element of dezinformatsiya,\n but propaganda per se lacks the precision and bite of disinformation.\n Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R000500010047-7\n\f Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R000500010047-7\n 6.  Soviet disinformation activity is planned and directed\n by a specialized Department of the Soviet State Security Service.\n This KGB Department, which was created to intensify Soviet\n disinformation activity, is headed by General Ivan Ivanovich\n Agayants, a senior, professional intelligence officer with long.\n experience and well-developed agent and political contacts in,\n Western Europe, especially in France, where he served under\n the name Ivan Ivanovich Avalov.  At one time in France he\n controlled the French spy Georges Paques who was sentenced\n to life imprisonment on 7 July 1964.\n 7.  The assignment of Agayants to take over the\n disinformation task indicates the high priority that the then\n Chairman o the Presidium, Nikita Khrushchev, gave to the campaign\n against American leadership and activity.  Chairman Kosygin and\n First Secretary Brezhnev have made no changes in that program.\n Department \"D\" is still directly tied into the Presidium in the\n planning of its work.:,\n *It will be recalled that;.Khrushchev, during his U. S. visit in\n September 1959, engaged in more than one discussion at the\n White House and during his tour designed to destroy confidence\n in American intelligence.  His statements and remarks made\n during interviews, it is known, were prepared in advance in\n consultation with the Department of Disinformation.\n Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R000500010047-7\n\f Approved For.Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80B01676R000500010047-7\n 8,  Agayants' Department is staffed by an estimated forty\n to fifty geographical and functional specialists in Moscow alone;\n it avails itself directly and peremptorily of the world-wide\n resources, manpower and operations, of the Soviet security\n apparatus.

It was my job to\n translate them into English.  Some other member\n of Vozny` s:: group would then arrange through local\n agents for the articles to be placed in one of the\n Burmese newspapers, usually pro-Communist-\n oriented.  The newspaper would translate the\n article into Burmese, make slight changes in\n style, and sign it from 'Our Special Correspondent\n in Singapore, for instance.

Although the KGB is able to fabricate in Moscow what-\n ever material is needed for its disinformation operations, it has\n been making more and more use of material published in the\n West, some of which had been planted there by earlier disinfor-\n mation activities.

I'\n Continuing Attack on the DCI\n 14.  The resignation of Mr. Allen Dulles and the appoint-\n r lent of Mr. John McCone necessitated a shift in the Communist\n attack on the Director of Central Intelligence.  The Soviet\n propaganda transition from one Director of Central Intelligence\n to another was accomplished by June 1963 with the publication\n o  a pamphlet entitled, Spy No. 1    Issued by the State Publishing\n House for Political Literature in Moscow (June 1963), the\n substance of the book is summarized on the title page:\n John Alex McCone is the Director of the\n Central Intelligence Agency of the United States.\n Behind the exterior of a respectable gentleman is\n hidden the seasoned spy, the organizer of dirty\n political intrigues and criminal conspiracies.\n This pamphlet tells of the past of the chief\n of American intelligence, of the methods by which\n he amassed his millions and became the servant of\n the uncrowned kings of America, the Rockefellers,\n and of the influence which McCone exerts on the\n policies of the US government, particularly in the\n Cuban affair. . . .

President Johnson's appointment of Admiral William\n F. Raborn on 11 April 1965 gave the Soviet press another\n opportunity to review and renew its attack on the DCI.  Moscow\n domestic radio announced the next day that the appointment\n signified the fu::ther strengthening of cooperation between the\n espionage apparatus and the military and military industrial\n monopolies. TT\n 13.  An editorial published on 14 April 1965 in the\n Tanzanian newspaper, The Nationalist, which was replayed by\n the New China News Agency, claimed that Admiral Raborn's\n appointment implied an \"attempt to save the face of the U. S.\n over accusations of interference in the internal affairs of newly\n independent- states in particular. \"\n 19.  Krasnaya Zvezda in Moscow asserted (18 April 1965)\n that the departure of Mr. McCone and General Marshall S.\n Canter was \"connected with new failures in assessing those\n forces against which American imperialism in aiming its\n aggressive blows.\"  The article concluded, \"The American\n imperialists probably assume that Raborn will be a more\n Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO1676R000500010047-7\n\f Approved For Release 2002/09/03 : CIA-RDP80BO16676, R000500010047-7\n successful accomplice for them in the struggle against the peoples\n of the -ocialist countries and other freedom-loving peoples.

On 5 June 1965, the Greek Communist newspaper Av;_;'-i,\n in an article entitled, \"U.S. Is Master Spy, William Raborn\",\n alleged that the appointment of Admiral Raborn was intended \"to\n lessen the enmity between the C.I.A. and the Defense Department\n Intelligence Service. \"  The article continued, \"The main reason\n is the fact that the key posts in the American administration are\n now being taken over by representatives of the top and overt form\n of monopolist capital, the most reactionary force that leans toward\n dangerous adventurism.

On Oct. 2,\n disclosure of the White House disinforma-\n tion campaign concerning Libya. On Oct.\n 5, the crash in Nicaragua of the C-123\n cargo plane containing the voluble Eugene\n Hasenfus and documents linking officials\n including Vice President Bush to an illegal\n Viewpoint\n By Alexander Cockburn\n arms-smuggling operation. In the weeks\n that followed, the confusions at Reykjavik\n and most recently, -Robert McFarlane's\n \"guns tor terrorists\" mission to Iran.\n The press, emboldened by this sequence\n of mishap and also by Republican reverses\n in the midterm elections, is now showing\n some signs of coming to life. Is it conceiv-\n able that the charmed existence-so far\n as critical coverage is concerned-enjoyed\n by this president is coming to an end, that\n the lap dogs will at last become watch-\n dogs? It is not as though the press has\n been uniformly and utterly bad. There's\n usually someone, somewhere trying to tear\n the lid off the bad news and expose the evil\n men. But what's one watchdog on the edge\n of town? It's the steady canine chorus that\n restrains government and serves the pub-\n lic weal. What we need now is a bit of pack\n journalism, baying along the fragrant\n spoor, but judging by present form we\n have a while to wait.\n Disinformation: When Bob Woodward\n of the Washington Post disclosed the pro-\n gram developed in August under the super-\n vision of Adm. John Poindexter of the Na-\n tional Security Council and designed to\n bamboozle U.S. journalists and Moammar\n Gadhafi in equal measure, there were bel-\n lows of outrage in the press and State De-\n partment spokesman Bernard Kalb rushed\n for the gangplank holding his nose. From\n most of the coverage you would have\n thought that disinformation from the Rea-\n gan team began and ended in late 1986. But\n it would have required no more investiga-\n tive zeal than a trip to the clip files to see\n that this administration has been practic-\n ing disinformation a lot longer than that.\n Back on Aug. 3. 1981. Newsweek ra-\n ported that CIA director William Casey\n had approved \"a large scale. multiphase\n and costly scheme to overthrow Kaddafi\n and his government\" by means including\n \"disinformation program designed to\n embarrass Kaddafi and his government\"\n At whom was the disinformation program    House suppliers is as broad as an inter-\n to be aimed? Col. Gadhafi, certainly, but                                              state highway. The breaches of the Boland\n also at the U.S. press. In December 1981  Amendment, the Neutrality Act and the\n headlines trumpeted out the news, leaked  Arms Export Control Act are plain for all\n by the administration, that Col. Gadhafi  to see. Congress banned arms to the con-\n had sent a hit team to assassinate Presi-                                               tras in 1984, and the White House promptly\n dent Reagan. By the end of the year, after went into the gun-running business. But yet\n a bracing spate of Demon Libya stories,   the press talks about the \"perception\" that\n the hit-team scare disappeared as sud-    the administration \"may have broken the\n denly as it came.                         law.\" Short of a signed confession from\n (Even if the watchdogs could be par-   Mr. Bush, what does it take to call a spade\n doned for ignoring the ancient history of a spade, or a broken law a crime?\n 1981, one might reasonably have expected    Reykjavik: The press found itself in the\n them, pondering Mr. Woodward's story, to  painful position, a few days after the sum-\n scrutinize once more the rationale for the                                                     mit, of having to turn to the Russians for\n bombing raids on Tripoli and Benghazi in  an acceptable\n non-disinformational\n ,\n ac\n July.

So much for the irrefutable effect of the unilateral Soviet test ban?\n evidence cited in July.)                  The McFarlane mission: The press is\n press about Libya would surely have no\n compunction in adopting the same tack\n about  Nicaragua.  But  when  Alfonso\n Chardy of the Miami Herald carefully doc-\n umented just such a disinformation cam-\n paign, the pack was silent.\n Mr. Chardy reported on Oct. 13 that the\n president had authorized this campaign at\n the start of 1983, calling for a \"public di-\n plomacy\" (i.e., disinformation) program\n superintended by the National Security\n Council and \"designed to generate support\n for our national security objectives.\" He\n ordered it to be merged with an incipient\n effort then called Project Truth. The public\n diplomacy program seems to have con-\n sisted mostly of leaking anti-Nicaraguan\n material to journalists who faithfully re-\n layed it to their readers without saying\n where it came from. The usefulness of this\n hot on the trail of this one, but it's hard to\n understand the surprise being voiced at the\n administration's arms supplies to Terror\n Central in Iran. The story has been around\n for a while. In October 1982, Moshe Arens,\n then Israeli ambassador to the U.S., told\n the Boston Globe that Israel had been sup-\n plying arms to the Khomeini regime \"in\n coordination with the U.S. government .. .\n at almost the highest levels.\" The next day\n he informed the Globe that he'd \"caught a\n little flak from the State Department\" for\n his indiscretion and then confided that\n \"The purpose was to make contact with\n some military officers who might one day\n be in a position of power in Iran.\" The ad-\n ministration may have been trying to buy\n back a hostage. It has certainly, in part-\n nership with Israel, been trying to buy into\n a future Iranian government, down the\n post-Khomeini road.\n operation, subsequently transferred to the    This is an administration that has\n State Department, was best demonstrated thought as much about news management,\n by the great disinformation coup of Elec- and practiced as much disinformation, as\n tion Night 1984, when television reporters- any in peacetime history.

He was\n interviewed by Edmond Jacoby of The\n Washington Times.\n Q: Pergamon Brassey's has just pub-\n lished \"Dezinformatsia,\" which you\n wrote with Richard Shultz. The sub-\n ject is Soviet \"disinformation\" pro-\n grams. Explain disinformation.\n A: \"Disinformation\" is one of two\n Soviet terms. Today they call it \"active\n measures,\" which is the use of overt\n and covert techniques to influence,\n deceive and mislead the target. The\n intention is to affect his behavior, to get\n him to act in a way that is detrimental\n to his own interest and, at the same\n time, to act in a way favorable to Soviet\n interests.\n Q: How does it differ from ordinary\n propaganda?\n A: \"Propaganda\" has many different\n meanings and people use it in different\n ways, but the essence of propaganda\n is to tell the truth as one sees it. It is to\n project one's views in a favorable way,\n and to show how the other side or other\n point of view or other product is not as\n good as yours. \"Disinformation\" uses\n a combination of truth and falsehood.\n Sometimes you use more truth, and\n other times more false information.\n In addition, propaganda is used to\n affect people's attitudes with the hope\n they will act a particular way. But \"dis-\n information\" is designed to lead to\n specific actions.\n Q: You have done some research on\n the recent \"Ku Klux Klan letter\" to\n foreign Olympic committees. What can\n you tell us about it?\n A: The letter allegedly written by\n the KKK to 10 or more countries in\n Africa and Asia ... to discourage them\n from attending the Olympic Games\n was an example of \"tactical disinfor-\n mation\" that was a part of an ongoing\n \"strategic disinformation\" campaign.\n It was a \"tactical\" move that had the\n initial objective of justifying the\n Soviet refusal to attend the Games,\n [suggesting! there were crazy people\n in the United States who would assault\n or possibly kill foreign athletes. But\n this was part of a \"strategic disinfor-\n mation\" objective the Soviets have\n been engaged in for decades.\n The Soviets are trying to suggest -\n as they did in their TASS reports -\n that the KKK was just the extreme\n [expression] of the American govern-\n ment, that this was just an extreme\n manifestation of American behavior -\n and specifically that the Reagan\n administration has been encouraging\n these kinds of activities.\n Q: Is it correct to say that the claim\n the KKK wrote the letters was\n accepted as fact around the world\n because people are predisposed to\n believe the KKK would do such a\n thing?\n A: That is correct. A good \"disinfor-\n mation\" officer will pick issues\n that seem plausible to the target. In\n this case, there is a KKK. It has\n engaged in terrorist activities. It is\n racist. It could conceivably have said\n some of the things [in the letter]. That\n was intentionally linked by TASS to the\n Reagan administration.\n Q: Can you describe the clues in the\n letter that point to KGB involvment?\n A: Sure. The evidence is very strong\n that this is a forgery. And without ref-\n erence to any forensic information the\n government might have in this case, I\n think one can demonstrate that this\n letter was produced by a fairly skillful\n - but not terribly skillful - \"disin-\n formation\" forgery specialist.\n To begin with, the letter is titled:\n \"The Olympics - For The Whites\n Only.\" Most Americans would have left\n out the article \"the\" I in front of\n \"whites?]. And if you look at the\n emblem on the I letter] itself, you will\n see that it is allegedly issued by the\n \"Ku-Klux Klan.\" The Klan does not use\n the hyphen when it refers to itself.\n Third, the emblem-fon the letter] is\n generic: There is no reference to the\n \"Klan in Virginia;' the \"Klan in\n Maryland\" or the \"Klan in Alabama\"\n Generally, each of the [KKK] units that\n Contir_ted\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/24: CIA-RDP90-00806R000200860001-4"

The subcommittee will come to order.\n Will your raise your right hand, Mr. Britt?\n Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be\n the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\n God?\n Mr. BRITT. T do.\n Senator GURNEY. Proceed, Mr. Sourwine.\n Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, I should like to make, a brief pre-\n liminary statement.\n Mr. Britt has testified under his real name, and is so testifying, but\n he is a refugee and because of that, and facts that would develop\n through his testimony, he has been helped to create a new identity.\n The committee is aware of the new identity, but with the Chair's per-\n mission, we will not refer to it at this time so our record will try to\n protect that identity.\n Senator GURNEY. I understand.\n Mr. SoURWINE. Sir, what is your nationality?\n Mr. BRITT. My nationality is Czechoslovak.\n Mr.--SOURWINE. Where were you born?\n Mr. BRITT. I was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia.\n Mr. SoURWINE. What was your education?\n Mr. BRITT. I got my education at Charles, University in Prague\n in the Department for International Relations, and I graduated; in\n 1954. Later in 1964 I enrolled in_the Charles University again, studied\n at the Department for Journalism and graduated in 1967.'\n Mr. SOURWINE. What has been your employment since you got out\n of there?\n Mr. BRITT. Several weeks before my graduation in 1954, I was\n invited by the Center Committee of the Communist Party of Czecho-\n slovakia and I was recruited as an intelligence officer for Czecho-\n slovak Intelligence Service. I served in this capacity until September\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 1968 when I defected and a, short time later I asked the American\n authorities for political asylum.\n Mr.  SOURWINE. I will say, Mr. Chairman, that the committee is\n aware of how Mr. Britt got to the United States and where he en-\n tered, but again if the Chair will permit, we will not go into that on\n the record.\n Mr. Britt, what rank did you achieve in the Czechoslovak service?\n M r. BRITT. I was a major.\n Mr. SounwINE. How high do the ranks run in that service?\n Mr. BRITT. The highest rank in the Czechoslovak Intelligence Serv-\n ice was the rank of colonel, so it was a high rank.\n Mr.  SouRwINE. How many majors were there approximately at\n the time you were in it?\n Mr. BRITT. I would say about, between 70 and 100.\n Mr. SounwINE. Have you any idea how many men altogether were\n in that service?\n Mr. BRITT. There were about 1,500 people in the Czechoslovak In-\n telligence Service.\n Mr. SouRwINE. I am talking about officers in the Intelligence\n Service.\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, sir.\n Mr. SoURWINE. What was the nature of your assignment? And if it\n changed, tell. us about that.\n Mr. BRITT. At the beginning I got an intelligence schooling. I went\n through a 6-month intelligence school in Prague and then at the be-\n ginning of 1955, I was appointed a research officer in the Department\n for Research and Analysis. I worked there until 1958, when I was\n appointed operational officer, an officer of the operational depart-\n ment for intelligence activities against Germany.\n In 1961, I was sent to Berlin as a member of the so-called resi-\n dentura there, covered as a cultural attache of the Czechoslovak Em-\n bassy in East Berlin. I stayed there until January 1963 When I re-\n turned to Prague to the headquarters of the Czechoslovak Intelli-\n gence Service and shortly after that, in February.of 1964, I was\n appointed deputy chief of the new Department for Disinformation.\n Actually in the parlance of the Soviet-bloc intelligence services, it\n was called the Department for Active Measures. I served as deputy\n chief of this department for 2 years, until 1966, when I was appointed\n ,in officer of the Czechoslovak intelligence station in Vienna.\n Mr. SouRwINE. Who was your chief in the Department of Dis-\n information when you were deputy?\n Mr. BRITT. My chief was Maj. TiH Stejskal.\n Senator GURNEY. What does this Department of Disinformation\n mean; that is, the word \"disinformation\" ?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, actually it prepares and carries out disinforma-\n tion, black propaganda and so-called influence operations. These op-\n erations, first of all, aim at influencing the sphere of public opinion\n of the non-Communist world, trying to deceive the world public opin-\n ion, to undermine the American positions all over the world.\n The second direction of these activities is deceiving deeisionmakers\n of the non-Communist countries, and to bring them to false decisions.\n In the parlance of the intelligence services it means to \"feed\"them\n with false information and expect that they will then use it as a basis\n for wrong conclusions and measures.\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n Senator GURNEY. I understand. I suppose false information would\n be a good description of the word \"disinformation.\"\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, sir; but, it is used in the intelligence services, it is\n a common term.\n Mr. SounwINE. To expand on that a little, with the Chair's permis-\n sion-is it true that the disinformation operation includes a number\n of specialized techniques? For instance, the Chair spoke of the actual\n dissemination of false information.\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, sir.\n Mr. SouRwINE. And there is the discrediting of factual information?\n Mr. BRITT. Right.\n Mr. SouRwINE. And of true informnat'ion.\n Mr. BRITT. Right.\n Mr. SotRwINE. Then there is the slanting with respect to public\n information, with a view, as you said, to bring about bad judgments\n and false decisions?\n Mr. BRITT.  Yes.\n Mr. SoURwINE. Now, are there other specialized techniques which\n you recognize and can tell us about atthis time?\n Mr. BRITT. Well, I think there are basically three types of opera-\n tions : disinformation, which means to feed an enemy, it can be the\n United States, Germany, Britain, any non-Communist country, with\n false information so that the counterpart, the enemy, takes wrong\n decisions.\n Second type are propaganda operations. It may seem strange that\n Soviet-bloc intelligence spends so much time .and effort on propaganda\n when every Communist-bloc country has a large official apparatus for\n the same purpose. It is true that Soviet-bloc intelligence takes\n over the role of a propagandist abroad whenever for ideological, moral,\n or tactical reasons the official propaganda institution can't do that. So\n for example, Eastern European intelligence services do not hesitate to\n do propaganda of fascist character in the name of some nonexistent\n Fascist organization if it serves the purpose. It is actually black propa-\n ganda as the real source is covered and the world public opinion doesn't\n know that it was initiated in Eastern Europe.\n Then, there is the third type called influence operations which are\n the most demanding and very rare.\n These operations are based on the activities of so-called influence\n agents, Communist agents working in non-Communist countries, who\n have important positions in the government, political parties or in\n Parliament. They can got instructions from East European Com-\n munist intelligence services, for instance, how they should react in\n Parliament, in a parliamentarian discussion or if they occupy an im-\n portant position in an enemy's intelligence service, what to do, in\n order to make it less efficient.\n Mr. SouRwINE. Are there persons of that nature in the United\n States, to your knowledge?\n Mr. BRITT. I have no knowledge of this kind of person in the\n United States.\n Mr. SouRwINE. I do not mean, sir, individuals whom you know per-\n sonally or know to be, but do you have reason to believe there are\n such individuals in the United States?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, I suppose so, yes.\n Mr. SouRwiNE. You don't have any examples?\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n Mr. BRITT. No, because the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service maybe\n was not as well established in the United States as, for instance, the\n Russian Intelligence Service could. As far as the operations carried\n out directly on the American territory are concerned, during the pe-\n riod between 1964 and 1966 when I was a deputy chief of that de-\n partment, this was very, very rare. Actually, I remember only one op-\n eration which was carried out anonymously in the United States in\n 1961 during the presidential campaign. It was a propaganda opera-\n tion against the presidential candidate, Mr. Goldwater, but it was not\n too successful because it was only a drop in the ocean of really existing\n anti-Goldwater opinions and propaganda.\n Senator GTTRNFY. You are saying we are doing a pretty good job\n ourselves without, the help of the Czechs?\n Mr. BRITT.  Yes, that is true.\n Mr. SOURwiNE. Can you give us an example of an operation of this\n type in any country with which you are familiar?\n Mr. BRITT. First of all, I would like to underline that most of these\n operations are parasites on the existing anti-American movements all\n over the world. It is very easy for the Communist intelligence service\n to start an anti-American operation in Africa, Asia, or Latin America\n because of anti-American movements and opinions which objectively\n exist there. Disinformation operations of the Communist intelligence\n services parasitize on these existing anti-American streams.\n I can give you an example of an operation which was carried out in\n 1964 and 1965, aiming at undermining American positions in Africa.\n Three forgeries of American documents were produced in Prague.\n The purpose was to reveal the United States as the major conspirator\n and enemy of the left-oriented African regimes. The first one was a\n forgery of a. letter by American Ambassador in Leopoldville to the\n Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I think. Together with the\n other two written in similar spirit, these forgeries were to prove\n American conspiracy against the leftist Tanzanian Government. They\n were leaked, to Tanzanian governmental officials but unfortunately I\n can't. say who was used as a channel because the Disinformation De-\n partment was not informed about the names of agents. We were\n responsible for preparation of these operations without being allowed\n to know the identity of people involved.\n Senator GmtwFY. Who would know these, within your intelligence\n svstem ?\n Mr. BRiTT. The so-called operational departments who are respon-\n s ble- to carry it out with the help of their agents. The Disinformation\n Department didn't have any agents, it prepared these operations, but\n didn't direct any agents. That was the responsibility of the so-called\n operational departments.\n Senator GURNEY. I take it your operation was somewhat compart-\n mentalized so one part would not know another part, where it was\n operating or what the names of the people were in another depart-\n ment.?\n Mr. BRITT.  Yes, in order to protect agents. Well, in this case, in\n this operation Oscar Kambond, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of\n Tanzania, presented the forgeries to the public as a proof of the Amer-\n ican conspiracy.\n And that was the start of a big anti-American campaign, not only\n in Tanzania but I would say all over the African continent. Tanzanian\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/1%: CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n President Nyerere hesitated to believe in these forgeries, he asked the\n American authorities for proof and shortly after that the American\n authorities presented the facts proving that all these documents were\n forgeries. President Nyerere accepted that, but the campaign contin-\n ued, because actually the press did not want to believe that they were\n forgeries.\n The second stage of the operation took place several months later\n when the Congolese rebellion forces were supplied with another for-\n gery, confirming, or trying to confirm, the American antileftist activi-\n ties in Africa.\n The forgery was published when Thomas Kanza, the Congolese rebel\n foreign minister, gave an interview to the East African Standard. Mr.\n Kanza said that the Congolese revolutionaries had documents prov-\n ing that the United States, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, South Africa,\n and Rhodesia had prepared the return of Morse Tshombe to the Congo\n and presented as a proof that forgery. And shortly after that Mr.\n Bouteflika, the Algerian Foreign Minister, made a similar attack at\n the meeting of African politicians in Nairobi, in March 1965. Many\n African news media published these pseudo-facts about the American\n conspiracy and the campaign continued for another few weeks or\n months.\n I think one of the reasons why this campaign, this operation was\n successful was that most of the African leftist leaders, politicians or\n journalists wanted to believe in that disinformation message. They\n were not careful enough to find out whether the documents were forged\n or not. They wanted to believe in them because they confirmed their\n opinion. I suppose that was one of the reasons why this operation, and\n many other operations, were successful.\n Senator GURNEY. Are we through with Tanzania?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. Let us go back to this United States political\n campaign of 1964.\n Can you describe the efforts and the techniques used by the Czechs\n in the political campaign?\n Mr. BRITT. As far as the technique is concerned, it was very primi-\n tive because the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service produced several\n forged documents and they were very cheaply forged. I can explain\n why. For instance the letter written by the American, supposedly\n written \"by the American Ambassador to Mr. Tshom'be\n Senator GURNEY. I'm talking about the 1964 political campaign\n here.\n Mr. BRITT (continuing). You mean the presidential campaign?\n Senator GURNEY. That is right; not the Tanzanian matter.\n Mr. BRITT. I think that it was a leaflet of several pages attacking\n Mr. Goldwater as a racist. Some facts in this leaflet about Mr. Gold-\n water were picked up from American books and newspapers and\n they were mixed with. sensational ingredients attacking Mr. Gold-\n water as a racist.\n Senator GURNEY. How were these distributed?\n Mr. BRITT. They were distributed anonymously. I think that these\n letters were sent to the United States in diplomatic bags and mailed\n by the members of the Czec'hoslovakian 'intelligence station in the\n United States.\n Senator GURNEY. In other words, mailed here.\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 6\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. Do you know to whom they were mailed?\n Mr. BRITT. The names were usually selected from various address\n books, \"Who's Who,\" and similar publications.\n Senator GURNEY. In other v, ords, there was ,a mailing list of various\n sorts.\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. How many were there, do you know?\n Mr. BRITT. I would say there were several thousand copies of this\n leaflet mailed.\n Senator  GURNEY.  Was there any other effort in that political\n campaign?\n Mr. BRITT. No, no other effort. That was the only operation which\n the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service carried out in the United States\n of America in 1964.\n Senator GURNEY. Now, how about 1968?\n Mr. BRITT. I can't say because at, that time I was not in the Dis-\n information Department any more.\n Senator GURNEY. Do you know whether any other Communist\n country in Europe, either Russia or Iron Curtain countries, do this\n as a routine thing in political campaigns?\n Mr. BRITT. The 'intelligence services have a green light to do it.\n There are no restrictions; but, they are careful, very careful, because\n it is dangerous from the operational point of view and from the po-\n litical point of view as well. It is dangerous to be directly involved,\n to have direct connections with dissidents, with the ultraleftists in\n the United States or in other non-Communist countries. It represents\n an execessive risk. because if the Soviet-bloc perpetrator is disclosed\n by a counter intelligence service, it would cause serious political harm\n to the Soviet Union and her prestige.\n A safer way how to misuse the ultraleft - of the non-Communist\n world is ideological influencing, leaving the initiative for individual\n violent or nonviolent actions in the hands of its leaders and that is\n not the job of Soviet bloc intelligence but supreme Communist party\n bodies. It is true that many Communist intelligence disinformation\n and propaganda operations are accompanied by outbursts, but they\n erupt spontaneously, inspired by disinformational messages rather\n than on direct initiative of the Soviet-bloc intelligence.\n The only case of direct involvement of the Czechoslovak Intelli-\n gence Service in organizing demonstrations and riots I know,\n happened in Panama in 1965.\n The Czechoslovak Intelligence Service didn't have any agents in\n Panama but had a lot of them in Mexico. Some of them were, I sup-\n pose, students, and again I don't know neither the identity nor the\n number of them because I was not allowed to. With their help the\n operation was carried out in Panama in 1965, a year after the clashes\n between American military forces and the students in Panama during\n which several people were killed. The Czechoslovak Intelligence Serv-\n ice decided to use the incident as a motive and base for an anti-Amer-\n ican operation there and develop a tradition of anti-American\n struggle, a day of fight against American imperialism.\n Every anniversary of the death of these Panamanian students was\n supposed to be commemorated by demonstrations and riots. The\n Czechoslovak Intelligence Service succeeded in instigating these riots\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/19 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n in 1965 with the help of the Mexican agents but a year later it didn't\n work any more and that was the end of the operation. This operation\n was the only one I know about when students were directly used or\n misused.\n Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire?\n Senator GURNEY. Yes.\n Mr.  SOURWINE.  Two different facets of that, one, leaving for a\n moment the activities in Latin America which we will come back to,\n I wanted to go back and lay a little foundation and ask a few ques-\n tions. The foundation lies in your use of the phrase \"the United States,\n the enemy.\"\n It could have been any free country, I take it, that means that the\n intelligence service of Czechoslovakia, and I presume of other Iron\n Curtain countries, regards every free country in the world as an\n enemy, is that correct?\n Mr. BRITT. The reason why I used the term is that United States\n is characterized in the long-range plans of the Soviet-bloc intelligence\n as enemy No. 1. There are certain priorities.\n Mr. SOURwINE. Why?\n Mr. BRITT. Because the United States is the most important rival\n of the Soviet Union, so not only the Soviet Intelligence Service but\n all satellite intelligence services as well consider the United States\n the enemy No. 1.\n Mr. SOuRWINE. Now, I want to get to the question, with that back-\n ground : Why was the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service interested in\n the Barry Goldwater campaign? What was the objective, what did\n they expect to gain, why were they attempting to discredit Mr. Gold-\n water as, as you say, a racist?\n Mr. BRITT. The reason why, I think was that Mr. Goldwater was\n considered a dangerous rival.\n Mr. SOURWINE. You mean you did this because he was an anti-\n Communist?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, strongly anti-Communist.\n Mr. SouRWINE. Opposed to the U.S.S.R.?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Mr. SouRwINE. Was he opposed to Czechoslovakia?\n Mr. BRITT. No, not .at all; the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service\n was only an instrument of the Soviet Intelligence Service.\n Mr. SouRwINE. Is that true in general?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes, it is. It sounds unbelievable or ridiculous that\n Czechoslovakia, a small country in middle Europe with the help of\n her Intelligence Service is involved in Latin America, Africa, Asia,\n and so forth. Doing things which don't correspond with real interests'\n of Czechoslovakia at all. This is not typical for Czechoslovakia only,\n all satellite intelligence services are primarily Soviet foreign policy\n instruments.\n Mr. SOURWINE. When you operated in Panama, your objective was\n a certain impact on the United States, isn't that correct?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Mr. SoURwINE. But when you operated with regard to Barry Gold-\n water, your objective was, as I understand your testimony, only to\n hurt an individual who, as an individual, was an enemy of the Soviet\n Union?\n Mr. BRITT. That was one reason. Another reason was to show an\n 62-432-2\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 8\n American presidential candidate as a racist and to influence the black\n part of the American population. against him.\n Mr. SOIIRwINE. Were you then making international propaganda\n against the United States by this charge of racism against Goldwater?\n Mr.  BRITT.  Yes; thousands of these anti-Goldwater pamphlets\n printed in English, French and maybe in Spanish too were distributed\n throughout the Third World pointing the United States as the enemy\n of nonwhite nations, but the effect was very limited.\n Mr. SouR.wINE. Now, I wanted to ask a few questions about the\n area of operations in Latin America that you opened up. You spoke\n of Panama. Do you have any knowledge of operations of the Czecho-\n slovak Intelligence Service in Cuba?\n Mr. BRITT. I know that Czechoslovak Intelligence Service had a\n large intelligence station in Cuba, in Havana.\n Mr. SOURwINE. When was this put in ?\n Mr. BRITT. I'm not quite sure, gut I think it was established in 1960\n or maybe 1.961.\n Mr. SOURwINE. Was this residentura operating against Cubans or\n was it using Havana as a base?\n Mr. BRITT. This residentura had to 'help the Cubans to learn the\n espionage business. At that time I think the Czechs were more ac-\n ceptable than the Russians.\n Mr. SouRwINE. You mean you were training Cubans in the intelli-\n gence business?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Mr. Sou wINE. To operate where ?\n Mr. BRITT. Especially in Latin America.\n Mr. SourwrNE. Did you train Cubans in the intelligencebusiness to\n operate as agents in the United States?\n Mr. BRITT. That is only my supposition. I think yes. I wasn't in-\n volved in operation activities against the United States, but accord.-\n ing to my knowledge, I would say \"yes.\"\n Mr. SouRwINE. Are you aware of the operations of the International\n Union of Students in Prague in training Puerto Ricans to operate\n as agents in the United States?\n Mr. BRITP. I know that in Prague there was a large Cuban intelli-\n gence station which operated with the help of the Czechoslovak In-\n telligence Service.\n Mr. Sou rwINE. Cubans were sent to Prague for training in large\n numbers?\n Mr. BRITr. Yes, many people from Latin American countries who\n were supposed to be trained[ came to Prague. Maybe I don't know\n how, whether they came over Canada or through other countries, but\n they came to Prague and they were trained there. How far Czecho-\n slovak Intelligence Service instructed them there, I don't know, but\n certainly there was, cooperation between the Czechoslovak and the\n Cuban Intelligence Services in Prague. The Cubans had ,a large villa\n there and a permanent Czech liaison officer was in daily contact with\n them.\n Mr. SouRwlxu. Do you have any knowledge of cooperation between\n the 'Czechoslovak Intelligence Service or its residentura in Havana\n and guerrilla operations run by Cubans elsewhere in this hemisphere,\n the Guevara type of operations ?\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/19 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n Mr. BRITT. I don't have any knowledge about it, but I can say my\n opinion on it. I would say that Cuba represents an important base\n for the penetration of the United States, certainly there are many\n refugees in the United States who could have been recruited not only\n by Cuban Intelligence Service but Czechoslovak Intelligence Service\n or Russian Intelligence Service as well.\n Mr. SOURwINE. This is a speculation based on your background\n knowledge, it is not an indication or statement that you know of this?\n Mr. BRITT. This is my speculation.\n Mr. SOURWINE. May I say something off the record?\n Senator GURNEY. Yes.\n (Discussion off the record.)\n Mr. SouRwINE. May we go back on the record?\n Senator GURNEY. Yes.\n Mr. SOURwINE. Do you have any information about the use of\n Cuban exiles in connection with guerrilla operations elsewhere\n in Latin America, either for or against such operations?\n Mr. BRITT. No, not at all. During the period between 1964 and 1966,\n the Department for Active Measures was not involved in influencing\n or directing guerrilla acts in Latin American or Asian countries, not\n at all.\n Mr. TARABOCIIIA. May I inquire?\n Mr. SouxwiNE. Mr. Tarabochia is our chief investigator and has\n special knowledge. May he ask any questions that occur to him?\n Senator GURNEY. Yes, at any time.\n Mr. TARABOCIIIA. You mentioned about the falsification of docu-\n ments, an accusation of the United States, an anti-Communist ele-\n ment in the Congo. '\n Are you aware that Che Guevara fought in the Congo against the\n government forces?\n Mr. BRITT. No, I didn't know about that.\n Mr. TARABOCIIIA. Did the misinformation or Disinformation De-\n partment of the Czechoslovak Intelligence ever mention the use of\n anti-Castro Cuban exiles fighting in the Congo?\n Mr. BRIT r. No, never.\n Mr. TARABOCIIIA. Going back to Panama, the riots January 9, 1964,\n were the direct result of agitation 'b student leaders who were mem-\n bers of 'the International Union of Students. Are you aware that the\n International Union of Students is based, the secretariat is based\n in Prague?\n Mr. BRITT. I would like to say that the riots in 1964 were the in-\n spiration for the later operation, but the Czechoslovak Disinformation\n Department was not involved in these riots in 1964, only later. I know\n about the fact that the International Union of Students has its head-\n quarters in Prague. I was personally in contact with the chairman of\n this organization who was my university colleague, Mr. Vokrouhlicky,\n but during the period 1964-66 'there was no direct influence of the\n Czechoslovak Disinformation Department on the International Union\n of Students.\n It is true that the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service planned to\n misuse 'the World Congress of that organization which was supposed\n to be held in Algeria for anti-American propaganda. However, Pres-\n ident Ben Bella was arrested and the congress didn't take place\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CI- RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n there. A year later, I think it was in 1965, the congress was to be\n held in Ghana and the same thing happened there. President\n N'krumah was overthrown and the congress had to be postponed\n until 1968 when it took place in Bulgaria, and I doubt whether the\n Czechoslovak Intelligence Service was involved there.\n Mr. TARABOCITTA. Did the name of Floyd Britton surface during\n the operation in Panama? Does the name of or are you familiar with\n Floyd Britton?\n Mr. BRITT. No.\n Mr. TARABoor-TIA. He was the leader of the students during the dem-\n onstrations which were supposed to take place in 1965.\n Mr. BRTrr. The problem is, following-I think you were not here\n when I spoke about the position of the Disinformation Department-\n the Disinformation Department was responsible for the preparation\n of all these operations but not for the execution of them because we\n were not informed about the channels, the names of the agents which\n was supposed to carry out those operations, for security reasons.\n Mr. TARABOC I-H A. That is all.\n Senator GTTRNEY. Mr. Britt, le't's go back to your statement that\n the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service was realy an extension of So-\n viet foreign policy; and as I also understood, you stated that is true\n of the Iron Curtain countries.\n Could you give uiis more detail on how this is done, for example\n does the head of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service report directly\n to Moscow? Do you go there for training? Do Russians come to Prague\n and tell them what to do? Give us some of the techniques involved\n here.\n Mr. Br,TTT. The Czechoslovak Intelligence Service after 1948 was\n built. up according to the Soviet pattern. Starting with 1949-50, many\n Soviet advisors came to Prague to direct the activities of the Czech-\n oslovak Intelligence Service. They stayed formally as advisors until\n 1961 when the official 'title changed to liaison officers. Anyhow, that\n was only a formal change. They still had the, same power as before.\n The mechanism of t6 Soviet influence is very powerful.\n The system of advisors is one way how the Soviets direct satellite\n intelligence services. Until 1963, every operation, even the most unin-\n portent one, had to be approved by an advisor first. When a Czecho-\n slovak intelligence officer wrote an operation proposal he had to visit\n his advisor, discuss it with him, rewrite it according to the advisor's\n critical review and only after that he submitted it to his Czechoslovak\n chief. The system of advisors is hierarchically structured. There are\n advisors who direct .activities at the department level, advisors who\n check everything at the level of the chief of the intelligence service,\n and finally there is a chief advisor for the Ministry of Interior who\n serves as the personal advisor for the minister. Understandably the\n advisors at the higher level have the right to veto all decisions of\n the subordinate advisors.\n Then there are. of course, other ways of the Soviet influence. If the\n Soviets need something from the Czechoslovak, East German, Hun-\n garian or Polish Intelligence Service they approach directly the chief\n of such service who gives the orders to the departments. Thus, people\n involved in such operation very often don't know that they are doing\n something for the :Russians because they got; instructions from the\n Czechoslovak Intelligence Service chief.\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/44 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n Then there are many people in the satellite intelligence services who\n have been professionally educated in the Soviet Union in the Intelli-\n gence School there. Until 1964 the intelligence school for Czecho-\n slovak officers took 2 years. After that, it was changed to 1 year only.\n Anyhow there was an order in 1964 that every chief starting with the\n position of a deputy chief of a department was supposed to be pro-\n fessionally educated in Moscow. Many of the officers who went to\n Moscow and carne back were critical of the Moscow intelligence\n school standards. The Russians didn't give them too much of their\n own experience .and newest techniques.\n The intelligence school in Moscow is another form of Soviet influ-\n ence. It dives the Russians a chance to get acquainted with the Czecho-\n slovak dicers, to study their character, their strength and weaknesses,\n level of the ideological indoctrination and devotion to communism.\n This kind of information is very valuable. For example in Czecho-\n slovakia in 1968 they knew very well who their people were, whom\n they could rely on.\n The influence of the Russian Intelligence Service on the Czecho-\n slovak or other satellite intelligence services is intensive, actually, the\n Russians can do with the satellite intelligence services what they want.\n Senator GURNEY. The school in Moscow, as I understood your\n testimony, is more to determine if students from Czechoslovakia are\n reliable and ideologically safe for Russia, rather than teach them\n intelligence techniques?\n Mr. BRITT. Right.\n Senator GURNEY. I think your testimony is, if I understand you\n correctly, that the school did not really give the Czechoslovak too\n much information on how the Russian Intelligence Service worked?\n Mr. BRITT. Right.\n Senator GURNEY. This method of direction by the Russians of the\n Czechoslovak Intelligence Service, and supervisions that you have\n described, was that still going on when you defected from Czecho-\n slovakia?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. So far as you know, that is still true today?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. So far as you know it is really a Russian Intelli-\n gence Service?\n Mr. BRITT. Yes; they get every piece of information, every mem-\n orandum they are interested in. They know the identity of all Czech-\n oslovak agents abroad, everything about the Czechoslovakian codes,\n the system of communications. Really, they have the whole Czecho-\n slovak intelligence net completely under their control and the same\n ap lies to other satellite services.\n Senator GURNEY. Do you know if the Russians divide areas of the\n world into assignments say to Czechoslovakia and Hungary and some\n of the others in order to make the intelligence coverage as wide as\n possible?\n Mr. BRITT. Again, I have, not read any document which I could\n reproduce, but I can tell you my own judgment, my own opinion\n about it.\n Until 1968, the Czechoslovak Intelligence 'Service was after the\n Soviet Intelligence Service the most efficient one of all the satellites.\n The situation has changed after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslo-\n vakia because several Czechoslovak intelligence officers defected which\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 12\n represented a considerable loss for the Soviets. Many Czechoslovalk\n agent nets were, destroyed or made inactive.\n The Czechoslovak Intelligence Service before 1968 used the broL,.t\n scope of 'Czechoslovak diplomatic relations for its activities. As far\n as America is concerned it operated in Canada, the United States,\n Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. In Europe\n it was Great Britain, France, West Germany, Austria, Belgium,\n Netherlands, Scandinavian countries Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, aid\n Greece. In the Middle East and Aftrica the following countries be-\n longed to the primary targets or operational bases : Lebanon, Syria,\n United Arab Republic, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Morocco, Guinea,, Ghana,\n Congo, Tanzania, and Kenya. Southern Asia and the Far East was\n covered by the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service in India, Indo-\n nesia, Japan, and maybe Ceylon.\n Speaking about Japan, only the Department for Scientific-\n Technical Intelligence operated there, not the departments for politi-\n cal intelligence as Japan was considered the domain of the Russian\n Intelligence Service.\n Senator  GURNEY.  You mentioned Poland, East Germany, and\n Hungary.\n Mr. BRITT. Yes.\n Senator GURNEY. I haven't, noticed that you mentioned Rumania or\n Yugoslavia. Is there any intelligence service under Soviet control\n there, as far as YOU know?\n Mr. BRITT. As far as Yugoslavia is concerned, there was no coopera-\n tion or connection between the Czechoslovak and Yugoslav Intelli-\n gence Services and I am sure that the same applies to the relations\n between Yugoslav and other Soviet-bloc services, the Soviet Service\n included.\n As far as the Rumanian Intelligence Service was concerned, start-\n ing with 1962 the relations deteriorated and Rumania, even if it was\n still a member of the Soviet-bloc intelligence community, it was not\n trusted any more as a reliable partner. There were still connections\n at the highest official level between the chiefs, but I would say that\n those were really only official formal connections, not efficient and\n productive ones.\n Mr. SouRWTNE. Mr. Chairman, I don't mean to digress, but may I\n go off the record a moment?\n Senator GTTRNEY. Yes.\n (Discussion Or the record.)\n Senator GURNEY. Back on the record.\n Mr. SOURWTNF. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Britt has written a book on the\n subject of \"disinformation\" growing out of his own experiences and\n knowledge. I understand the book is going to be published and I do\n not want to try to beat him to the punch with his own book, so to\n speak, but there are a number of technical questions I should like to\n ask while Mr. Britt is here, if I may ask those at this time.\n Senator GURNEY. Very well.\n Mr. SouRWTNE. Mr. Britt, will you tell us as much as you can of\n the organization of the disinformation department of which you\n were an assistant director?\n Mr. BRTTT. Well, the organizational structure of the Czechoslovak\n Disinformation Department changed in details several times during\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/13: CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n the time I worked there as its deputy chief, but the basic scheme re-\n mained unchanged.\n The Department was headed by a chief and one deputy chief. Four\n territorial sections formed a backbone of the Department. It was\n German-Austrian section, European section, covering the rest of the\n non-Communist Europe excluding Germany and Austria, American\n section and the section covering the developing countries of the Middle\n East, Africa, Southern Asia, and the Far East.\n Then there were three specialized sections, the first for disinforma-\n tion activities against foreign intelligence and counterintelligence\n services, the second for coordination of military disinformations and\n the third for economic disinformation.\n All of these sections were responsible for developing new ideas and\n plans which were then carried out with the help of the operational\n territorial departments of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service.\n Finally there was a section for analysis and documentation and an\n archive collecting signatures, letterheads and all kinds of model letters\n and documents which could be used as patterns for forgeries.\n Mr.  SOURwINE.  Mr. Britt, give us the names and positions and\n duties of top officers of that department as best you remember them?\n Mr. BRITT. There were about 20 people working in the disinforma-\n tion department. According to security rules they were supposed\n to address each other only under cover names. That's why I don't re-\n member all real names of my subordinates even though I was entitled\n to know them.\n The department was headed by Maj. Tiri Stejskal who until 1963\n was the chief of the Latin American Operational Department. In the\n mid-fifties he served in Austria and was expelled from there as per-\n sona non grata,. As his deputy I was responsible mainly for the men-\n tioned territorial sections. In 1966 I was succeeded by Liev. Col. Karel\n Frerund who for a long time had been the director of the Ministry of\n Interior Press Department.\n The people working in the department were mostly experienced\n intelligence officers who had spent several years abroad and had the\n necessary knowledge of the problems and mentality of countries they\n covered. Thus, for example Maj. Ludvik Neckar who was respon-\n sible for operations on the American continent had spent 4 years in\n Brazil, Maj. Vaclav Louda a specialist for developing countries had\n worked for several years as the chief of the North American Terri-\n torial Operational Department and had spent some time in Canada\n and Great Britain. Maj. Jaroslav Nemec was specialized in opera-\n tions against foreign intelligence and counterintelligence services. His\n name became famous in 1959 when he had to leave Austria in a hurry.\n He was a member of the Czechoslovak intelligence station in Salz-\n burg at that time and was instructed to deliver laxabive powder into\n Radio Free Europe-RFE-dining room saltshakers in Munich\n through one of his agents. The operation didn't succeed as the agent\n was in fact an American double agent, Nemec was exposed and im-\n mediately for security reasons had to leave Austria. Maj. Jardslav\n Kazbal covering Europe had spent several years in Great Britain,\n I think, and in Turkey or Greece. This very short and basic charac-\n teristics give you at least a very brief idea what quality of officers\n worked in the department.\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 14\n Mr. SOURWINE. Mr. Britt, tell us what were the major and minor\n objectives of your department and how they were related to each\n other?\n Mr. BRITT. The major objectives of the Disinformation Depart-\n ment were summed up in a long-term plan of disinformation opera-\n tions covering the period of 5 to 7 years.\n The Czechoslovak plan which was worked out in 1965 under the\n Soviet; supervision characterized the United States as the enemy No. 1.\n The primary goal was to isolate the United States in Europe, Latin\n America, Asia, and Africa morally and politically and to promote the\n withdrawal of American military from Europe.\n As far as priorities are concerned the NATO was the second most\n important target. The Czechoslovak Intelligence Service together\n with other Soviet-bloc intelligence services was supposed to work for\n disintegrating of the NATO countries partnership to the extent that\n the Atlantic Alliance wouldn't be renewed in 1969. As you know this\n didn't happen.\n German Federal Republic followed as the third most important\n target. According to the long-term plan disinformation operations\n were to aim at weakening the alliance between West Germany and its\n Western partners presenting West Germany as a Nazi seedbed.\n The territory of developing countries represented the main battle-\n field in anti-American activities as the majority of operations was\n carried out there and it was the territory where the Czechoslovak In-\n telligence Service registered greatest successes.\n Mr. SotrrwINE. Please go into detail with regard to the types of\n operations that were carried out, using as many examples of actual\n operations as you think would be necessary to make it a clear and\n comprehensive exposition of what was done.\n Mr. BRITT. Operation called Research, conducted in the mid-fifties`\n was directed against North American influence in Latin America. The\n Czechoslovak Intelligence Service noted the unsuccessful American\n efforts to survey public opinion in Latin America which became\n famous as the Project Camelot, and decided to continue in the name\n of the United States. In forged questionnaires, the respondents were\n asked to answer a battery of very personal and sensitive questions con-\n cerning themselves, .and they have been even asked to characterize po-\n litical orientation of their friends which reeked of denunciation. The\n whole survey could be construed as American interference in the in-\n ternal affairs of the countries involved. The completed questionnaires\n were to be sent to American Embassies. Among the addresses were a\n significant number of peopla known to Czechoslovak Intelligence\n Service for their anti-American opinions, who could be relied upon\n to arouse, scandal and agitation over the brutal methods of American\n inquiry. The calculation was correct. The Americans became once\n more target No. 1.\n As an example of an operation directed against an individual can\n serve .a Russian operation scandalizing Mr. Anthony Courtney, Con-\n servative member of the British Parliament. On one visit to the Soviet\n Union, Courtney invited a woman employee of the Soviet State Tour-\n ist Office to his hotel room. The result was a series of intimate p'hoto-\n m aphs taken and published by the Soviets in the form of a pamphlet\n and sent to prominent British citizens and newspapers. There was a\n difference of 4 years between the hotel adventure and the distribution\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/1015CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n of the pamphlet. In all probability, the Soviet Intelligence Service\n hoped to use the compromising, photographs for recruitment. When\n it realized that it was not possible, it decided to use the material for\n a subversive public relations campaign against Courtney. The leaflet\n provided impetus to jokes circulating among the British political\n aristocracy. It is difficult to estimate what degree British public\n opinion was influenced. The fact remains, however, that Anthony\n Courtney was not reelected as a member of the Parliament in the next\n parliamentary elections.\n Mr. Souizwzxr. Please discuss specifically the exertion of influence\n with special. reference to the influential individual that you mentioned\n earlier in your testimony.\n Mr. BRITT. Your question, as I understand it, relates to the category\n of the so-called influence operations or influence agents. As I have\n already mentioned, the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service certainly\n didn't have as many influential agents as the Russian service had or\n has, nevertheless, there were several developing countries where the\n Czechoslovak Intelligence operated successfully with the help of these\n agents. It was, for example, the United Arab Republic. The Czecho-\n slovak Intelligence Service had several agents there, in the state hier-\n archy, who served as disinformation channels for material produced\n in Prague and Moscow. Their prominent positions offered Moscow\n a chance to leak disin form ation.al material directed mainly against\n the United States of America and to a lesser degree against the German\n Federal Republic and Great Britain. This material consisted of forged\n data on various anti-Arab plans and subversive activities by the United\n States.\n In this connection I would like to mention one thing. It would be\n a big mistake to make a conclusion that Communist agents have suc-\n cessfully penetrated all. the non-Communist world and that they are\n responsible for all its trouble and problems. This espionage paranoia\n typical for the 1950's can actually only innerly weaken the democratic\n world. In the present competition between the Communist and the\n non-Communist world, Soviet-bloc intelligence is only one of many\n foreign policy instruments, ,and certainly not the most important one.\n Communist disinformation, propaganda and influence operation can't\n win that competition. The new Communist espionage paranoia would\n be a tragic mistake for many reasons, and I would like to mention\n at least one. It creates dirty waters in which especially the Commu-\n nist intelligence knows how to fish and thus it would be completely\n counterproductive. It was not a good fortune that the Communist\n intelligence services registered their greatest successes in the 1950's.\n The atmosphere of those years was a fertile soil for their activities.\n Mr. SOURWINE. Finally, please tell us as much as you can from your\n own knowledge about the operations of all disinformation agencies\n of Iron Curtain countries, or perhaps you should tell us what you\n know of any other Iron Curtain countries' operations.\n Mr.  BRITT. The Soviet Disinformation Department which repre-\n sented a center for disinformation activities of the Soviet bloc was\n established in 1959, and headed by General Agayants, an Armenian\n with intelligence experience going back several decades.\n The Czechoslovak Disinformation Department between 1965-66\n maintained direct contact not only with the Soviets but the Hun-\n garian and East German counterparts as well. According to the Soviet\n 62-432-3\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : frIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n idea this was supposed to be .a way to make the disinformation ap-\n paratus more productive and efficient. The East German department\n was headed at that time by Liev. Col. Wagenbrett and the Hungarian\n department by Maj. Janos FYarjes. While the East German depart-\n ment scored most successes in West Germany the Hungarian Depart-\n ment spent most of its energy fighting against the Hungarian desk of\n the Radio Free Europe.\n Three were several more or less ineffective operations which the\n Czechoslovak Disinformation Department carried out together with\n these satellite copartners, mainly against West Germany and Austria.\n The situation radically changed in 1968. Czechoslovakia, once a part-\n ner and very productive source of disinformation and propaganda\n operations against the non-Communist world became herself a target\n and victim. The Soviets with the help of satellite intelligence services\n and Stalinists from the Czechoslovak state security organs launched\n a series of operations of this kind against the democratization move-\n ment and its representatives using forgeries, anonymous threatening\n letters, a special newspaper, radio broadcasting, leaflets, books, and\n many other forms of persuasion. They even hid weapons on the Czech-\n oslovaa-k territory and anonymously informed the Czechoslovak police\n about the hiding place, trying to create an impression that the weapons\n belonged to the counterrevolutionary underground and had been de-\n l ivered by Western intelligence services. Despite this extensive effort,\n disinformation, propaganda, and influence operations against Czech-\n oslovakia totally failed. It was the Soviet Army which defeated the\n new Czeehoglovak regime, not the Soviet Intelligence Service.\n For me personally this was a period of reevaluation of my life. I\n identified myself openly with the new regime in Czechoslovakia and\n after the invasion refused to follow orders from the occupied Prague\n headquarters. The only solution left for me was a life of a political\n exile. Maybe; I am too personal in this part of my testimony, but I\n think it belongs to the \"corn\" of the problem we are speaking about.\n In 1968 looking back into my own past I realized that the psycho-\n logical warfare operations I participated in during my appointment\n in the l)isinformnation Department was .a bad service especially for\n my own country. It was one of the reasons why I defected.\n Mr. Sounw 1cn. 1VIr. Chairman, may I ask if anybody here has fur-\n ther inquiry or anything he would like to have opened up on the record\n again?\n All'. MARTIN. I have one question. I wonder if the witness would\n have any information on contacts between disinformation apparatus\n and elements in the American media, that is, with or without the\n knowledge of these elements in the American media. When they were\n in contact with members os the disinformation apparatus, did you\n consistently try to use contacts in the American media for spreading\n disinformation in this country?\n Mr. RRTTT. I. understand. There were several levels of disinforma-\n tion influence on t'he mass media. There were newspapers which were\n owned by Czechoslovak Intelligence Service. Then there were news-\n papers where one member of the editorial staff was recruited as an\n agent.\n :llr. SonRWINE. Talking about newspapers in the United States?\n Mr. BRrrT. All over the world. I will specify it later, as far as the\n United States is concerned.\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/1011 CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n The third and most of often way of influencing mass media was called\n \"anonymous way.\" Letters have been produced in name of various\n individuals which pretended that the letter writer for patriotic or\n nationalist reasons, hatred toward Americans or for other reasons\n decided to publicize a sensational document-mostly a forgery-which\n was enclosed.\n Until 1964 the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service owned a news-\n paper in Brazil. After the coup d'etat there the publication of the\n newspaper was ceased by the new government and the Czechoslovak\n service lost that propaganda channel.\n Mr. SouawiNun. Do you know where in Brazil that paper was\n published?\n Mr.  BRITT.  It was in Rio. Later the Czechoslovak Intelligence\n Service changed this practice and didn't buy newspapers abroad any-\n more as it was disadvantageous both from the operational and the\n financial point of view. After the coup in Brazil, the newspaper was\n stopped and the Czechoslovak Intelligence Service lost not only the\n channel but the money it put into this project as well. That's why the\n Czechoslovak service later relied more on recruiting individuals in\n editorial staffs.\n According to my experience, most of them were in second- or third-\n rank newspapers. I have no knowledge about any agent who would\n be established in the most important newspapers of the world like, for\n instance, the New York Times, the British Times, Le Monde, Frank-\n furter Allgemeine Zeitung, and so forth, because these editorial staffs,\n these newspapers are financially strong and the correspondents are\n mostly experienced people who are aware of the danger of Communist\n intelligence services.\n On the other hand, it was easy to recruit second- and third-class\n journalists in small newspapers, mostly in developing countries, which\n were permanently in financial trouble.\n As far as the United States is concerned I don't know about any\n journalists recruited for the Czechoslovak or any other Soviet-bloc\n intelligence service and I don't know any newspaper under direct\n influence of Communist intelligence either.\n Mostly what happened was that a newspaper was supplied with\n documents or forgeries through the mail, and it depended on the\n newspaper whether it believed in it and accepted it or not.\n Mr. MARTIN. It would also depend on the quality of the forgery\n or disinformation that had the quality of apparent authenticity, even\n an intelligent man might be disposed to accept it?\n Mr. BRIT'r. Yes; I might say not all the operations were based on\n forgeries. There were even operations which used genuine American\n documents.\n For instance, in 1969, at the time I was already in the United States,\n reading foreign newspapers I discovered a new disinformation and\n propaganda operation against the United States which I think, is of\n Russian origin. Several editorial staffs in Europe, in West Germany,\n Italy, France, and Great Britain received a letter with top secret\n American military documents. The documents wore mailed from\n Rome and accompanied by an anonymous letter explaining that the\n letterwriter was a friend of General Wendland, who as a deputy chief\n of the West German Intelligence committed suicide in 1968. According\n to the letterwriter General Wendland was disturbed by the content\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 :1SIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n of the American documents because Europe including the territory\n of W'st Germany was supposed to become a major battlefield and\n target for American atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons in\n case of a war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sev-\n enl nowspapers and magazines devoted a lot of space to these docu-\n ments, some of them even mentioned the Soviet Disinformation Serv-\n ice as a possiible initiator but the edge of critique aimed at the United\n States. The campaign continued for several months. Anyhow, it was\n clear that the documents were not valid anymore otherwise the Soviets\n would not use them for propaganda purposes. The Russians got the\n documents from an American sergeant who was arrested in the United\n States in 1964.\n Senator GURNEY. Does anyone have any more questions?\n Mr. MARTIN. I just wanted to ask whether you have named two\n different ways in which the disinformation apparatus worked through\n the free world, three ways actually-first, by recruiting agents; sec-\n ond., by feeding documents which are in fact forgeries but which ap-\n pear authentic to innocent members of the press or innocent editors;\n and, third, by feeding to the press documents which are genuine but\n whose publication serves the interest of the Soviet Union.\n Are there any other ways, to your knowledge, which the disinforma-\n tion apparatus works through the free world media?\n Mr. BRITT. Well, certainly there are other ways. Once the Czecho-\n slovak Disinformation Department had a professional schooling, an\n educational session on. professional disinformation techniques and var-\n ious new methods were discussed. Czechoslovak officers were impressed\n by the propaganda success of an operation which might have been\n initiated by the East German Intelligence Service. Two television\n journalists got an interview from a man who had spent several years\n in Congo as a mercenary and was known in Germany as Congo-Muller.\n He thought that he was giving the interview for a West German tele-\n vision station. Under the influence of alcohol he lost all moral inhibi-\n tions and started to boast of his military career in Congo. Several\n weeks later the interview was broadcast to his large surprise by the\n East German television. In 1968 the East Germans registered a sim-\n ilar success with Dr. Walter Becher, spokesman of the rightest\n Sudeten (erman movement in West Germany. I can't and I don't in-\n tend to impiicate the two journalists as East German intelligence\n agents as I don't know anything about them, but propaganda success\n of tlreir operation was remarkable.\n The is another thing that I should mention. When the Disinforma-\n tion Department wanted to carry out a big campaign in one country,\n it used to surface the disinformation message in another coup-try in\n order to protect the people who were directly involved. For instance, I\n remember that an anti-American black propaganda campaign in\n Indonesia in 1964-65, initiated by Prague, started with an article pub-\n lished in a Ceylonese newspaioer. Only after that, first publication it\n was transplanted on the Indonesian press. At the beginning of my\n testimony I mentioned the three basic types of operations disinforma-\n tion, black propaganda and influence operations. You can hardly find\n pure types as mostly every operation involves elements of all types,\n but the majority of these operations can be characterized as black\n propaganda operations. They are the easiest for an intelligence service\n can execute them even without hell) of agents. The operational depart-\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n 19\n ments of the Intelligence Service, and I believe the reaction is the same\n in the Russian Intelligence Service as well as in the Czechoslovak In-\n telligence Service, do not like operations involving their agents. The\n operational departments don't like to risk their agents because their\n primary task is to gather information with the help of these agents.\n When the agents are involved in disinformation or propaganda opera-\n tions, it is risky, and all operational departments try to avoid that risk.\n That's why the disinformation message is most often delivered\n anonymousl~yy.\n Senator GURNEY. Does anyone have any further questions?\n Mr. SouRWINE. If we close the record here, we will not be foreclos-\n ing the witness from providing any additional information that may\n occur to him, because he will have an opportunity to correct the record\n after it is filed.\n I am sure the committee is appreciative of your helpfulness in\n coming down, Mr. Britt. We will get this transcript to you as soon as\n possible.\n Senator GURNEY Thank you again, Mr. Britt, for your helpful testi-\n mony.\n The committee will now adjourn, subject to call.\n (Whereupon, at 11:50 a.m., the hearing this day was concluded.)\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n INDEX\n (NOTE.-The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee attaches no significance\n to the mere fact of the appearance of the name of an individual or organization\n in this index.)\n A                    Page\n Africa ------------------------------                       4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14\n ----------------------- :Agayants, General --------------------------------------------------- 15\n Algeria ---------------------------                                   ---- 9,12\n Anti-American -------------------------------------------------- 4, 6, 7, 9, 14\n Anti-Communist -----------------------------------------------------    7,9\n Argentina -----------------------------------------------------------    12\n Asia --------------------------------------------------------------- 4,7,14\n Atlantic Alliance ----------------------------------------------------   14\n Austria ---------------------------------------------------------- 12,13,16\n B\n Becher, Dr. Walter---------------------------------------------------    18\n Belgium ------------------------------------------------ --- --     -  5,12\n Ben Bella, President-------------------------------------------------     9\n Berlin --------------------------------------------------------------     2\n Bouteflika, Mr. (Algerian Foreign                                         5\n Brazil ----------------------------------------------------------- 12,13,17\n British Times (newspaper)-------------------------------------------     17\n Britt, Lawrence -----------------------------------------------------  1-19\n Britton, Floyd ------------------------------------------------------    10\n Bulgaria ------------------------------------------------------------    10\n C\n Canada ----------------------------------------------------------- 8,12,13\n Castro, Fidel -------------------------------------------------------     9\n Ceylon -------------------------------------------------------------     12\n Charles University ----------------------------------------------------   1\n Chile ---------------------------------------------------------------    12\n Communist --------------------------------------------------------- 3,6,15\n Intelligence ---------------------------------------------------- 3,4,17\n Party, Center Committee of_______________________________________         1\n Congo, the ------------------------------------------------------ 5, 9 12X18\n Congo-Miill.er ------------------------------------------------------    18\n Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs_________________________________    4\n Courtney, Anthony --------------------------------------------------- 14,15\n Cuba -------------------------------------------------------------- 8,9,12\n Havana ---------------------------------------------------------          8\n Intelligence Service ---------------------------------------------   8,9\n Cuban exiles --------------------------------------------------------     9\n Czechoslovakia ------__                                       _- 1, 7, 11, 16\n Department for Disinformation__________________ 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16,18\n Intelligence Service ________________________________________ 1,2,4-17,19\n Prague ------------------------------------------- 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18\n D\n Department for Active Measures_________________________________________ 2,9\n Department for Research and Analysis--------------------------------      2 Department for Scientific-Technical Intelligence________________________    12\n E\n East African Standard (newspaper) ----------------------------------      5\n East German Intelligence Service_____________________________________ 10,18\n Embassy of Czechoslovakia, East Berlin__________________________ ____-    2\n Europe -------------------------------------------------- 3,6,7,12-14,17,18\n Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73B00296R000200170082-2\n\f Approved For Release 2002/01/10 : CIA-RDP73BOO296ROO0200170082-2\n II\n F\n Page\n Far East -------------------------------------------------------------\n 12,13\n Federal Republic of Germany ------------------------------------------\n 14,15\n Foreign Minister of Algeria-.------------------------------------------\n a\n France  ---------------------------------------------------------------\n 12,17\n Frankfurter Aligemein Zeitung (newspaper) --------------------------\n 17\n Fremund, Liev.

Instead, the Commu-\n nist  disinformation  network  was\n caught, shall we say, red-handed.\n The fundamentals of the story\n were spelled out by our Gordon Cro-\n vitz last Wednesday. Mr. Roulette is\n author of \"La Filiere \" or \"The Con-\n nection.\" a book that suggests the CIA\n W Agca to shoot John Paul H. In re-\n cent weeks he was quoted by the Bul-\n garian press agency as saying that he\n had received files proving Agca was\n coached to blame the Bulgarians.\n These files were said to have come\n from Francesco Pazienza, a former\n Italian military secret service agent\n jailed in New York while fighting ex-\n tradition on bank fraud charges stem-\n ming from the collapse of Banco Am-\n brosiano. Interviewed in New York,\n Mr. Pazienza said no such files ex-\n isted. And reached at an unlisted sub-\n urban Paris number supplied by the\n Bulgarian Embassy in Washington,\n Mr. Roulette admitted he had not ac-\n tually seen any files.\n This drama played itself out in\n Judge Severino Santiapichi's court-\n room. Mr. Roulette had requested to\n testify, writing a letter talking of files\n belonging to Mr. Pazienza. By the\n time of his appearance Friday, The\n Wall  Street  Journal/Europe  had\n printed the Crovitz story, which was\n then reported in the Friday editions of\n the important Rome daily Corriere\n Della Sera. Judge Santiapichi, it de-\n veloped, was well prepared.\n The judge first asked what Mr.\n Roulette was doing in his courtroom.\n Mr.  Roulette  began  to  mention\n \"files,\" at which point Judge Santiapi-\n chi asked what files. Mr. Roulette\n said he hadn't actually seen any files.\n Well, the judge asked, what had he\n seen? He said he had a letter from\n Mr. Pazlenza.\n Judge Santiapichi then held up a\n copy of Mr. Pazienza's letter and\n asked a startled Mr. Roulette if this\n was the letter he meant. Yes, it was.\n Judge Santiapichi then informed the\n court and Mr. Roulette that there was\n no reference to any files that would\n clear the Bulgarians or any files in\n any Paris bank vault.\n Mr. Roulette was then asked why\n Mr. Pazienza had written him. He re-\n fused to answer. The judge threatened\n to have Mr. Roulette arrested for\n \"reticence.\" He relented and said that\n a client of his, Luigi Cavallo, had\n written to Mr. Pazienza asking about\n the pope plot and that he'd passed the\n letter on to Mr. Roulette. At the men-\n tion of Luigi Cavallo, the court press\n reporters began hooting. Mr. Cavallo\n is a renowned propagandist and ac-\n cused blackmailer who is in a French\n jail awaiting extradition to Italy. HC\n is also a former Communist leader\n 4nd the editor of a newsletter that as\n blamed the CIA for the pope shoot-\n ing-\n It's rare to uncover so blatant an\n effort at disinformation. Either Mr.\n Roulette said he'd seen files that don't\n exist or the Sofia Press Agency chose\n to report that he had seen such files.\n Whichever, the ploy managed to at-\n tract articles in important Italian and\n American newspapers. The trick of\n disinformation, of course, is to get\n credible sources to print lies that they\n believe to be true. We did not notice\n Mr. Roulette's embarrassment re-\n ported over the weekend on this side\n of the Atlantic, which is regrettable,\n since Western journalists have a clear\n interest in untangling disinformation\n when it occurs.\n More broadly, it's instructive to\n ask why disinformation is flying so fu-\n riously over the pope plot trial. While\n Agca has in the end stuck by his\n charges that the Bulgarians assisted\n and directed him in the shooting, his\n bizarre testimony clearly hinders a\n courtroom conviction. But for the Bul-\n garians and their Soviet sponsors, the\n nagging question has been, who had a\n motive to kill the pope?\n The Soviets clearly resented the el-\n evation of a Polish pope just when\n they were faced with Solidarity and\n general resistance in Poland; for\n them he was a clear problem. No one\n any longer believes Agca acted alone\n out of some anti-Christian fervor. The\n disinformation effort has been poin\" d\n at creating some other motive out of\n the .murky scandal involving the P2\n Tome Banco   rosiano     est-\n ern intelligence. But in this effort the\n disinformation experts had little to\n work with, and had to invent the far-\n fetched tale that exploded in Judge\n Santiapichi's court Friday.\n Whatever the courtroom verdict,\n this outcome should be kept in mind\n by anyone trying to discern what hap-\n pened in the pope plot. For with the\n collapse of the effort to concoct a plot\n involving Western scandals, we are\n left where we began. No one had a\n motive except the Soviets.\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/08/23: CIA-RDP90-00552R000505100018-3"

In fact, he comes\n Soviets in Western media to\n further their aims. Is it really\n dangerous?\n De BORCHGRAVE: The\n most important media voice in\n France, Jean-Francois Revel,\n who was editor and chief of Le\n Express, wrote a new best-\n seller, How Democracies Per-\n ish. In it, he demonstrates how\n disinformation has quite liter-\n ally presented a new ideology.\n It has one basic principle - to\n consume a society and stifle\n the revolutionary ardor of\n Western workers in order to\n bring down capitalism. It\n shows how disinformation\n preys on the lifeblood of de-\n mocracy.\n USA TODAY: How can dis-\n information do that?\n grey expected to make intelli-\n gent decisions on an adminis-\n tration request for funding the\n contras who are fighting the\n Marxist Sandinistas in Nicara-\n gua? On the basis of what they\n have read about Nicaragua in\n our media? The consensus is\n that the Sandinistas are a popu-\n lar, home-grown revolution.\n It's no such thing.\n USA TODAY: But is disin-\n formation really that perva-\n sive in the USA?\n - DeBORCHGRAVE: There\n are about three examples in\n the press every day. The State\n Department has issued eight\n reports in the last two years\n which cite disinformation ex-\n amples by the score. I could\n not find one journalist in 300\n who interviewed me on a re-\n cent book promotion tour who\n had ? heard of these reports,\n down very hard on the U.S.\n press covering Nicaragua for\n being taken in by a larger\n group of Marxist international-\n ists.\n USA TODAY: But how has\n the American press been tak-\n en in?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: You see\n mass rallies in favor of the San-\n dinistas on your evening televi-\n sion news. What you've never'\n been told by our media is that\n ration cards are confiscated if\n you fail to show up at these so-\n called spontaneous rallies. Peo-\n ple are jailed simply for asking.\n Sandinistas embarrassing ques-\n tions.\n USA TODAY: Are you say-\n ing that the press is deliber-\n ately suppressing some sto-\n ries about Nicaragua?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: I don't\n think the stories are being\n spiked. They were just never\n written. When I was down in\n Nicaragua, the local guru of\n the press corps was Bianca Jag-\n ger, playing the role of the\n Jane Fonda of Central Ameri-\n ca. She was organizing trips to\n Mosquito Indian land to show\n happy Indians resettled in their\n new villages. Did that ever\n come out in the press, how re-\n porters were getting to these\n villages? Not a word came out,\n and I watched for it\n USA TODAY: How did dis-\n information as a political tool\n evolve?\n De BORCHGRAVE: It start-\n ed right after the Soviet revolu-\n tion. The head of the Cheka,\n the forerunner of the KGB,\n started Department D, which\n stood for demoralization. He\n was in charge of running de-\n moralization operations in cap-\n italist countries. When Yuri An-\n dropov took over the KGB in\n 1967, disinformation became a\n full directorate, known as Ser-.\n vice A. The general in charge\n told his staff: \"We must all con-\n vince Western journalists, ei-\n ther directly or through third\n parties, of exactly the opposite\n of our real intentions. If any-\n one writes about our real inten-\n tions, it must quickly be dis-\n missed and ridiculed as a man\n or woman of the right, as a fas-\n cist and McCarthyite.\" This is\n quite extraordinary because it\n has worked over and -over\n again.\n USA TODAY: Were some of\n the first stories about Yuri\n Andropov - that he was a\n closet liberal who' loved ii.\n American jazz - examples of\n disinformation?\n .DeBORCHGRAVE: I was\n having breakfast with the for-\n mer head of French intelli-\n gence when that story -first\n came out He told me, \"There\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/02/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000201460020-0"
