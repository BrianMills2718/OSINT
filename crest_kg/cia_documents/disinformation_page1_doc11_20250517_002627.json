The CIA denied\n it.  And President  Reagan also denied government      involvement, but\n he  admitted  the White House did know about private American help\n to the Contras.\n PRESIDENT  REAGAN:    We've  been  aware   that  there  are\n private  groups and private  citizens  that  have  been trying to help\n the  Contras,  to  that  extent.    But  we  did not   know  the  exact\n particulars of what they're doing.\n COLLINGS:    Some critics  on  Capitol  Hill thought    the\n Administration knew    a  lot  more than that.\n SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY:  The Administration  is skating   on\n the knife-edge of credibility.\n COLLINGS:    I'm Anthony Collings  in Washington.   Welcome\n to Newsmaker Saturday.\n Credibility  is    once again  an  issue.   Critics  find it\n hard to believe when     the   Administration says  the Iceland meeting\n OFFICES IN: WASAHIfMroved T.C For i RNEIeiVI -a YORK ?\n LOS ANGELES ? CHICAGO ?

Wasn't  there a disinformation campaign?\n SENATOR  WILLIAM              COHEN:    Well,  first  let me  be very\n clear.   The committee itself did not make an investigation.            The\n Chairman  of the Intelligence Committee,         Dave Durenberger,  and the\n chief of staff,  Bernie McMahon,          made an inquiry.   And        they were\n satisfied  there         had been  no,    quote,   official    campaign for\n disinformation.  Which   is  not   the    same   as saying       that stories did\n not   leak  into the   press  or  were  not         deliberately leaked  by\n certain     individuals that  may         have  planted  false  stories  or\n misleading stories.      But     there    was   no evidence,  according  to\n their inquiry, of an  official campaign          orchestrated and organized\n by     the White House.\n COLLINGS:   But  the White House spokesman,  Larry     Speakes,\n used the word \"authoritative,\" referring  to  the         story,         as  if  it\n were deliberate and     intentional,      not just...\n SENATOR COHEN:   I     think  there  were  individuals   within\n the  State Department,       perhaps  in  other  facets of the White House\n operation,  of  individuals   who indeed  did believe    it  was  important\n to     try  and  disseminate  information       that might  keep   Qaddafi,\n quote, off  balance.    I    think  that  they  now recognize  the  dangers\n in  using,  in any way,      the U.S.  media to convey   information which\n is patently      false.\n COLLINGS:   Admiral Turner,  do you agree that  there is        a\n danger  in  this, or  do you  feel  that  it's  a  good  thing?\n ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD        TURNER:    Oh, I think disinformation\n can be used quite to  our  advantage  and  it's       a  good  thing  to    do\n from  time  to  time.    But  on  the     one   extreme, you  can      have  a\n disinformation program that    disinforms  only  one      person.       And  I\n could cite  an  actual   case        that  I participated in   where     we did\n that  very  effectively  for  our country.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:  Can you cite that case?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Yes. We tried to get  the ambassador   of\n a foreign country,     who was democratically inclined,  to go back to\n his  country  and  engage  in  a  dispute  that  was  going  on  in  the\n government  about  whether it  should be  moved to the  left.    And  we\n disinformed  this  ambassador  about  his        own  status in  his own\n country,    and he went home to take care of his      own problem, and we\n got  him    into the  fray  in fighting for the   democratic side.   It\n was a very useful thing.   Didn't happen     to win,  but        nonetheless\n we  disinformed him    and  he did  do what we wanted him  to do.\n COLLINGS:  Are you saying you lied?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: Yes,  we lied    to him   and we made this\n man believe something was going  on that    affected him  in     his home\n country     that  was  not  going  on.   But we  got  him  back  into the\n fray,  so to speak.\n On  the  other  extreme,     you can  disinform  the  whole\n American      public,  or   the  whole  world,  practically.      And in\n thiscase,  the Administration      was  insensitive to the       degree which\n they   were    moving away  from  a   single disinformation  to  a  very\n broad  disinformation.\n COLLINGS:   Arnaud de Borchgrave,    the Soviet Union has a\n campaign of disinformation,      as we  know.         Aren't  we stooping to\n their  level when we    do the  same  thing?\n ARNAUD  DE   BORCHGRAVE:   Well,  first,  I       have to make a\n correction       about the  Wall  Street     Journal  story.     It was\n authoritative.       As  a  matter of   fact,   what  was happening  in\n Tripoli at that      time was a meeting with President Assad of Syria;\n Ghebril     (?),  a  well-known  Palestinian  terrorist;         Abu Moussa,\n another well-known Palestinian terrorist; the head        of the Iranian\n Revolutionary  Guards.      And French counterintelligence  happens  to\n know  that     they  were  at that very moment plotting some terrorist\n actions in Western Europe.\n COLLINGS:      But we  know that  Poindexter  talked  about\n Qaddafi being quiescent.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He was not  quiescent.   There was...\n COLLINGS:      Whatever reports there  were,  they  weren't\n clear that he was planning new terrorism.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Because we  in  the  media  were  not doing\n our  job.   They  put  out   a statement,  the Libyan news  agency -- I\n don't  know  why  we didn't pick  it  up.  They   said,  \"We  are setting\n up     special  revolutionary --  secret   revolutionary cells  in many\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n Western     countries  in  order to launch attacks against America          in\n such  a  way   that they  will  not  be  able  to  retaliate  with       their\n aircrft     carriers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"            This\n was a direct quote     from the Libyan news agency.\n He  was  not  quiescent.   But  again,  that's conventional\n wisdom right  away,   he was quiescent.\n As  for  the  Soviet Union,  you know that  they spend three\n to   four   bil-l,ion  d ollars  a  year an  active  measures,           which\n encompasses all    forms  of disinformation.   We have printed as         fact\n in  our media countless Soviet      forgeries. And  I could              spend  the\n next two hours reciting them from memory.\n COLLINGS:  Well,  don't  do that,  because we want  to talk\n about American disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   We    don't  get  involved in that.   We do\n not  plant  disinformation  in our  own    media.   As the Admiral       said,\n abroad  there are some disinformation       operations that go on.         But\n let's make quite clear that there is a major  difference               between\n strategic deception,  which we were involved in against Qaddafi to\n destabilize him,      psych him,  psychological  warfare;        and       all that\n was  indeed           going  on, and for  a  very  good reason.   He considers\n himself to be  in a permanent state      of war with the United States.\n COLLINGS:   Strategic deception.     Lying,  in    uther words.\n Do you approve?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:       Strategic        deception  in   a  military\n COLLINGS:    Do you approve?\n SENATOR  COHEN:     I  think we  have  to draw  a distinction\n once    again.    It's  one  thing  to have  ships   steaming  toward      the\n coast  of  Libya.      That  is a fact  if we are doing it.   It's quite\n another to,               I think, publish reports, feed reports  to  American\n journalists   and  suggest      that  there  is  a coup  in      the    making  to\n ovrethrow Qaddafi,     that he  is  internally         unstable,  that we  are\n giving     aid  and comfort,    as  such,  to those       forces  who wish  to\n overthrow      him,    when in  fact   the   situation   might              be quite\n different.\n As  far     as  Qaddafi himself, it's perhaps a bad example.\n But nonetheless what     it does    is  it throws that seed  of      disbelief\n or  lack    of  credibility     out there so that we are never believed.\n If in fact we have...\n COLLINGS:    We have to take a break at  this point,  and we\n will be right back.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:      On   Newsmaker   Saturday,   our   topic   is\n disinformation  and  credibility.\n Admiral   Turner,   in World War II the United States lied\n about  the location  of  the   invasion  at  Normandy  in order  to save\n lives   of American soldiers.   That was wartime.   We're not   at war\n now,  and yet we are still     lying.   Why  is that?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:      There     are  some times,  even   in\n peacetime,  when you do lie.   A     friend  of mine,  for instance,  was\n asked  by  a newspaperman  the      day  that the  Iranian rescue operation\n was  actually  taking  place,  \"Is  there  not  a      rescue   operation\n taking place?\"    And my friend,   very  appropriately, said,  \"No.\"\n He  called  the     newsman  the next   day and          said, \"I\n apologize.          I deliberately lied to you.   But there were lives at\n stake yesterday,  and so I could not even waffle my    answer to you.\n I  had  to be categoric in  saying no.\"\n COLLINGS:   So when lives are at       stake,  it's  all  right.\n Are  there any  other  conditions  when  it's all  right?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   We  think  of ourselves as being at, peace\n and we think       of peace treaties and armistices and truces       and war\n and  declarations  of  war.        Some our  adversaries  in   this  day  and\n age  don't think that  way.    They  consider     themselves  to be  in     a\n permanent  state  of war  with  Western  democracies,  albeit  conducted\n through  indirect  means,   whether it's subversion  or  penetration       or\n disinformation or state-sponsored terrorism.\n COLLINGS: But that's what      they consider.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Yes.\n COLLINGS:   Why    should we   think  the  same way  they  do?\n Why  should we behave the same  way  they  do?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   If  people consider      themselves to be at\n war  against  the  citadel  of  capitalism  --  namely,  the  United\n States --  as  they  call  it,  well,    then, obviously we  have to\n react.       And you're not going to be conducting   this according to\n the Marquis   of Queensberry's  rules,   are you?\n COLLINGS:   Senator Cohen,  do you think we should use the\n same means  that  they do?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,  I  think  one  of the difficulties\n with making  such    a  broad  statement is  that    if  you  adopt. the\n policies  that the Libyans  or  the Soviets  or  any  other  countries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n who  have  declared  war,   active  or  covert,   or  terroristic     or\n conventional, against  the United  States,  it    seems  to me  if that's\n the general proposition,     then you can always say  it's    open for us\n to deceive the  enemy.   And  the  question is,   how  does  one  go about\n deceiving the enemy?\n It seems to me that if  we adopt  that  as     a general\n policy,   that it's all right  to put  deceptive measures         into the\n media  to convey  that  to keep the enemy guessing,  then we have a\n question  of  when  do the  American   people     really  believe   that\n the  President or  the  White  House    or  the   Congress is     actually\n telling them the truth.     Right now...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      That's   our     job,   Senator.     As\n journalists,  we  can't        be  spoon-fed.     When  we  say       in   our\n profession,   \"We've  been   lied     to,\"   that is     sanctimonious,\n hypocritical  nonsense.      What  government     has  not  lied?   What\n government  has not misled  or     tried  to mislead the press?\n So, what are we? Are  we  journalists,     or  are we  just\n conveyor belts for government    information?\n SENATOR COHEN:        That assumes that the government         is in  a\n state  of  constantly lying to the press.   I don't believe that      to\n be  the case.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No,  it  isn't.   But  we can see through\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:       And that's what was so foolish          in this\n case.  Because the day  after the Wall Street Journal printed that\n story, Leslie Gelb  of the New York      Times just decimated it      in his\n paper because it was a bad story.   And the Administration        should\n have   recognized that  planting  something  like  that  in the U.S.\n media  was  bound  to blow  up  in  their  face,  as  it  did.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    They did not plant it  in the U.S.  media.\n That has been determined. There was nothing planted  in the         U.S.\n media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER: That      certainly  is      not  true.   That's\n just an assertion by...\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No.   No,  not  at  all.   You can check it\n out.   And in fact,  the Intelligence Committee has checked it      out.\n There  was  a  memo  floating  around,  a  memo  floating around --    I\n think  the  Senator  can  confirm      this. No  disinformation      was\n planted in the U.S.  media.\n ADMIRAL      TURNER:   Oh, that's certainly untrue.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   At that time?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   That's  certainly untrue.   Now,  it may\n not  have     been  authorized by the  President of  the  United  States,\n but  disinformation  was  planted by  somebody  in   the  Administration.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Even the Wall   Street  Journal  will    tell\n you  that     they  were not victims  of disinformation.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,   they're  trying  to cover  their\n number,  too.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  No.       Because there were two things that\n were  correct  there, Admiral,  and   we  just    discussed  them  at  the\n top  of the program.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   You  have heard  they   are correct.   I\n don't   agree with     what  you said.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  You're not part      of the Administration.\n Here's someone who's on the Intelligence Committee.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   He's  not part  of the Administration.\n He's  in the Congress.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He's  done  his homework.   And Bernie Kalb\n resigned   on the  strength      of    Bob  Woodward's  piece   in    the\n Washington    Post, not   on     the   strength  of  anything  else    he\n discovered.\n COLLINGS:     All  right, but  he  did resign.    And   that\n implies  that  he    felt that the Administration had  lied  and had,  in\n fact,  gotten caught    lying.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: He     took  Bob  Woodward's    piece at  face\n value.    And  even   Bob   Woodward  corrected           his piece three days\n later.\n SENATOR COHEN:   The nature  of the problem is,  as we're\n seeing now with            the alleged involvement in Nicaragua of the CIA,\n if  you  took  a poll  on the streets  of America,      I  suppose that the\n majority       would come  back  and  say, \"We don't  believe  the  denial.\"\n And  that  is  the  difficulty  that one  has  once   you  are  perceived to\n have been deceiving    or planting stories   or not  leveling with    the\n American       people. It      tends  to undermine everything, even when\n you're right.      That's sort  of    the road  you  walk  down. Once you\n take  a   lie  and   give    it  the  perfume  of  truth,  ultimately what\n happens    is  truth  has  the  perfume   of  lies.    And  no matter how\n truthful       your  statement  might  be,     it is perceived  to  be  a\n falsehood.     And that's  the  danger  we   run.\n So,  we've  got   to have  those c                t     hick we\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07: CIA-RD gf 8g 01  666900~8d(fi%-\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n in fact\n o\n t  i\n do\n engage in disinformation be very,  very clearly  spelled\n u\n n\n oli\n our\n own minds as to when it's justified.   But as a general\n p\n cy,\n we\n lose,  ultimately,  when  we  are        perceived  to  have\n engaged\n or\n pursue a policy  of engaging in disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    But  haven't  all  Administrations  had\n credibility gaps,  Senator?\n SENATOR COHEN:     Oh,  of       course.     That's  a constant\n problem with the Congress,   as well: Do we have a credibility gap\n between  what we  say  and  what we  do?\n COLLINGS: How does     this  Administration  compare with\n others in terms     of credibility gap?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:      I  am  yet to meet  a  public official,\n whether it's here  or abroad,    who doesn't speak with three voices:\n the      on-the-record voice,    beyond-the-record  voice,    and the\n background voice.  And sometimes they're 180 degrees apart.\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:  But  if  you  look   at  the  record, this\n Administration's credibility has been challenged much more often.\n I  look  on   it  from a rather  parochial  point     of view\n because I worry about      another wave of public lack  of confidence\n in  the  CIA.   And these  two  events,  the  shooting  down of the\n airplane in Nicaragua and the   disinformation  against   Libya are\n reviving that  again,  just  as  we  had  with  the     mining of the\n harbors  in Nicaragua and   the manual  of   assassination  and the\n assassination   effort     against  a man named Fadlallah in Beirut.\n All of these...\n COLLINGS:   Well, what do you think  is the extent  of CIA\n involvement in Nicaragua?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:    Well,  I think  there's  very  little\n question that the CIA  is providing help and support  and advice to\n these people who are  freebooters and are doing things down there.\n They're doing it       on the verge of the law.   I don't think they're\n doing anything technically  illegal.\n COLLINGS:     But   when   they       deny  it, then   it's   a\n credibility  problem.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   They're perfectly proper in denying it.\n But  their credibility  is  bad  because  they're   working     on   the\n wording of the  law,  not  on the  spirit  and  the  intent  of  the  law.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Have  you       noticed,  Admiral,    how  when\n somebody goes   down  and fights against  the communists in a Third\n World country he becomes a vulgar mercenary,  and if someone is\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n fighting     on  the  communists's  side  he  is  treated  with awesome\n veneration?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   I  certainly don't  have any veneration\n for the Sandinistas.   I don't know what      you're talking about.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No, but an American was killed  fighting\n with  the  Sandinistas   a     couple of  years  ago,   and  it  made        a\n paragraph    or  two in  the  papers  and  he was called  an  idealist.\n COLLINGS:   Well, we'll take a break  at  this      point,    and\n then we'll be  right back?\n COLLINGS:     We're   talking   about   truth,        lies   and,\n credibility....\n Admiral  Turner, how     much long-term      damage     is  being\n caused  to  the  CIA    and   to  the  Administration     by  the  kind     of\n credibility gap you've been talking about?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: I think  it's considerable because    it's\n happened     over  a considerable period of time.         We must remember,\n Tony,  that the  most  fundamental     strength  of       our country  is  a\n well-informed      electorate,    well-informed citizens. I think the\n citizens     have been  not  well  informed  in  these   cases  and      the\n citizens     are  going  to question  what  the government says  in the\n future.      And  that will  be  very injurious     to  our  democratic\n process.\n COLLINGS:   And yet   you yourself say that  disinformation\n COLLINGS:    How can you have it both ways?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Because you don't want  to disinform the\n American     public.     The instance I  cited  to  you, the   American\n public      never  knew  about   it, because  it  was a  very   limited\n disinformation program.   You    have  to take  some  risks        once  in  a\n while.      Disinforming  one  person  is  an extreme case.   Sometimes\n you disinform a larger group.   When you do it      overseas,     which you\n really  should --  you    never should do it  in the United States --\n you are risking  that  it  will                  come  back    into  the  United  States\n media  because we  really  have  one world    media.  So,        again,    you\n have to be very careful about     it.\n Much  of  the disinformation the United States  needs to\n put  out really   isn't disinformation. It's getting into other\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n countries true information by  surreptitious means,  often,     because\n it  won't get  in any  other way.\n COLLINGS:    We'll put that  aside  and  just         talk  about\n disinformation.\n Senator?\n SENATOR  COHEN:  Just  to  correct  a point.   Number one,\n the  CIA     was not  involved  in  a  disinformation    campaign,  for\n openers.   They  are  not  involved.\n Number two, I think that the CIA has enjoyed an increase\n in its stature in     the  past  four  or  five  years.  Certainly  the\n morale  is  much  higher  than  it  has    been in recent years.    And I\n think that  the  public   has taken a  different  attitude  toward  the\n CIA,  in     view  of  the kind  of circumstances we  find ourselves in\n globally.\n Number three, the   lack  of credibility,  I think, starts\n from the top-down.    A point  you made  in your opening  statement.\n It  seems    to me incomprehensible  as  to why  the    Administration\n would say    no deal has  been made with respect  to Mr.  Daniloff.   A\n deal  clearly was  made,  a  bargain    was  struck,  and they ought to\n say so.      Everybody else knows that.   And for the Administration,\n the President to say,        \"No trade,\" it  simply   starts taking the\n shine off the credibility.   And that     tends to filter down.\n But       as  far  as the CIA  is concerned, we have known for\n several years the Administration does want to maintain a vigorous\n campaign of support          for the Contras. The CIA will  in  fact play a\n role  in that  support.      Both  Houses of Congress have   voted  for\n such   a   measure.         It's waiting  for conference  action at this\n point.\n So,  I would say  it's somewhat misleading to suggest that\n the CIA now has a lack  of credibility.      It's  something  that  may\n affect     all of government, to the extent that we don't    level vith\n people on items  that  are   clearly          within  the  public domain and\n which common sense tells     them...\n COLLINGS:    Let  me  ask  you  this.   Your  committee  has\n oversight  responsibility    for  the   intelligence  community.    How\n much  attention  do you  devote to the question of disinformation,\n to make sure that there's no violation  of            the  guidelines on not\n misleading the American public?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   We  maintain a          very  vigorous oversight\n program.   I     think  that's why  we're  satisfied  the  CIA  was  not\n involved   in    any disinformation  campaign.    To  the  extent there\n were  individuals  within    the  White  House         or  within  the State\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release-2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901R000600400018-2\n Department    who  may   have  briefed  a          reporter  and  gave  him\n misinformation or disinformation,  that         should  not  be attributed\n to the        CIA.   This  was specifically n  of  a CIA program.   The CIA\n is looked at  very closely by us.\n COLLINGS:    Admiral,  you were about to make a point.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:      Well,  I was  going  to say  that it  is\n illegal,  I  believe,  Senator,  today        for  the  CIA  to support the\n Contras.\n SENATOR COHEN:    That's correct.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Other than with  intelligence  support.\n SENATOR COHEN:     Other than with communications...\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Communications and intelligence.   So if\n they had any  role in the airplane incident,  it was  an illegality.\n It may not be illegal tomorrow,  if the Congress  passes  this  new\n law,  but it has been illegal up till now,        was illegal  if they did\n something yesterday.\n I  think  the  genesis  of  the whole Wall Street  [Journal]\n disinformation problem was a misinterpretation  by  the  CIA  of an\n intelligence         report  that     said Qaddafi was on the verge of being\n able to be toppled.    I       think  they  fell  for that one when   they\n shouldn't have because they wanted to believe that.\n SENATOR COHEN:   Can I  kind of just   contradict that for a\n moment?       The       CIA  was never misled  by  any report  that  said Qaddafi\n was  on the verge of being toppled.         From all the information that\n I  saw,  that clearly  was  not    the  case.   That information, wherever\n it came,  did not      come  from intelligence sources.\n COLLINGS: Let me ask you about...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   The Admiral made a point  about       credibi-\n lity  and                       said  that it's     very important  that  we  not  question our\n government,  that     we believe   our government.   I hope  that  in  this\n profession,        Admiral,  we  never  stop      questioning our government.\n That's   part            of the democratic process.   Always  question your\n government.   That's what makes  it  a healthy society.\n COLLINGS:        But   the  government   has     to   take into\n consideratin  the  fact  that  it's being questioned by       the press.\n But  it has certain objectives,            which  include  goals that  can be\n achieved by   lying,     in effect.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Every     Administration,  Tony,       tries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n every Administration,  Tony,  tries to manage the news...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   ...and  put  the  best  face  possible  on\n what  they're  doing.   And  our  job  in  the media is to try to see\n through    it.\n COLLINGS: Let me  ask  you about the Soviets.   How much\n mileage do you  think they will get   out  of the problems that    have\n cropped up  recently with Administration credibility,  on Libya,     on\n Nicaragua, on other matters?\n SENATOR   COHEN:   Well, in a recent item that  appeared in\n the      newspaper,   the   Soviet Union       jumped   upon Secretary\n Weinberger's  statement     that  the Soviets,  to the extent that they\n pulled any troops     out  of Afghanistan,  will only replace them with\n fresh  troops. The Soviet paper clearly jumped on that      and said,\n \"We are surprised and shocked that a high       official  would  engage\n in such,    quote,  a falsehood.\"\n COLLINGS:   We have only  a few seconds  left.\n Admiral   Turner,    what's   your   view   on   the Soviet\n exploitation of this credibility problem?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I think they  will  do everything\n they  can  to  exploit  it.   I'm not  sure  it  will get   them a lot of\n mileage,    truly.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    Our   problem  is  that   we're choirboys\n trying to deal with Jack the Ripper.\n COLLINGS: Okay.

November 1984 \nA Letter to the Editor of the New York Tribune \nSirs: \nLev Navrozov, in his articles published in the August 23rd \nand October 1, 1984 issues of the New York Tribune, made a \nnumber of malicious attacks and insinuations against me and my \nrecent book, \"New Lies For Old.\" In his articles, he questions' \nthe historic evidence which I produced and also my access to \nthe KGB and its secrets. He stated that this evidence consti-\ntuted my personal inventions and fantasies. I wish to assure \nyou and your readers that my knowledge about the Central \nCommittee's and KGB's preparations for the adoption of the new \nlong range policy and the active role of the KGB in it, was \navailable to me because I had witnessed these preparations while \nI was both a student at the KGB Institute and a senior officer \nof Soviet Intelligence at KGB Headquarters in Moscow. During \nthe period 1957 - 1959, the KGB Institute was directed, by the \nCentral Committee, to prepare numerous studies regarding the \nuse of intelligence and security assets for inclusion in the \nstrategies against the West. These studies were made available \nto the Institute students and were discussed at the conferences \nof the Institute. At that time, I read the secret report of \nShelepin regarding the new political tasks of the KGB. The KGB \nInstitute played a major role in the re-assessment of Stalin's \npolitical practices and the shift to a Leninist approach. While \nat KGB Headquarters during 1959 and 1960, I personally witnessed \nthe KGB reorganization, its political reorientation, its practical \npreparation for strategic disinformation and its active role in \nthe realization of the new strategies. During this same period, \novert political consultations between party leaders occurred as \nwell as many secret consultations between KGB officials and \nsecurity chiefs of the bloc countries. I personally witnessed \nthe formation of the Disinformation Department and monitored \nits beginning. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-2-\nGiven this evidence, the substance of my book is not \ngroundless fantasy as intimated by Mr. Navrozov, but instead \nan expose and a realistic description of the Communise' \nStrategic Disinformation Program in action. This program, \nwhich was launched in 1958, has seriously damaged Western \ninterests and greatly benefitted our Communist adversaries. \nIt has further generated a great deal of confusion regarding \nCommunist developments in the minds of Western analysts and how \nto deal with them. It has created a crisis in the West which \nis being successfully exploited by the Communist strategists. \nMr. Navrozov has misinformed your readers by stating that my \n'book is Soviet agitprop, i.e., propaganda. My book is con-\ncerned with Communist strategies and strategic disinformation, \nand is definitely not about propaganda. The book demonstrates \nthat the Communists are presently determined to win the political \nstruggle with the West, utilizing their strategies and strategic \ndisinformation and not through Communist propaganda. Their \nstrategic disinformation program has helped them in the success-\nful realization of some of the Communist strategies and has \ncreated a critical situation because the West, albeit unwittingly, \nhas helped in the realization of the Communist strategies. For \nexample, it was Communist strategic disinformation which in the \n1960's was responsible for the unilateral United States reduc-\ntion in arms which resulted in the Soviet military superiority \nand the decline of the U.S. from its military superiority posi-\ntion. \nI would like to point out yet other gross inaccuracies made \nby Mr. Navrozov in his articles. He equates Stalin and Shelepin \npractices in the use of Communist priests, writers and scientists. \nHowever, the practices cannot be equated. Stalin, as it is well \nknown, imprisoned, exiled or shot scientists, writers and priests \nwho failed to do his bidding, as evidenced by the death sentences \nfor twenty Jewish writers during the period 1948 - 1952. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-3-\nShelepin, in contrast, resorted to an active use of scientists, \nwriters and priests in the Strategic Disinformation Program. \nIt is in this context that one should examine the actiVist role \nof the academician SAKHAROV or the writer TWARDOUSKIY. Such an \nexamination would explain why the omnipotent KGB tolerated the \nactivist role of SAKHAROV up until 1980 and his long and unin-\nterrupted contacts with prominent Western correspondents in \nMoscow, and why the KGB overlooked the mailing of letters and \nmanuscripts by SAKHAROV to persons in the United States since \n1968 and again recently from his place of exile. What was the \npurpose of injecting the letters of SAKHAROV in the American \ndebate on the arms race and what effect did they have on the \ndebate? An effective examination of SAKHAROV's pronouncements \ncan be made only in terms of the Soviet military strategy, the \nSALT negotiations and strategic disinformation. It may be that \nsuch an examination would reveal that his pronouncements were \nactually designed by the Communist strategists to influence \nAmerican policies, the SALT negotiations and the arms race debate. \nOne should also ask the question whether SAKHAROV's pronouncements \ncontributed to the emergence of the nuclear freeze. debate in the \nUnited States. SAKHAROV, in his 1968 treatise, predicted that \nthere would be an attack against the U.S. militarism at the \nbeginning of the 1980's. I can understand why SAKHAROV was \ncorrect. Such an attack on U.S. militarism was attempted in \nrecent times in Western Europe. \nAnother example of Mr. Navrozov's complete disregard for \nthe facts can be cited. In my book, \"New Lies For Old,\" I \ndescribed how the KGB, under Shelepin, drawing on its experience \nin successfully manipulating its controlled political opposition \nagainst the West, as in the well known operation \"Trust\", decided \nto again use the KGB controlled opposition in the framework of \ntheir long range strategy. Such KGB designs provide an oppor-\ntunity to analyze the dissident movement in the U.S.S.R. as a \nnew \"Trust\". Mr. Navrozov tries to defend the dissident move-\nment, completely ignoring past experiences and the new KGB design \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \nto manipulate the political opposition. I find this kind of \nattitude in a dissident as rather strange. Further, his boast-\nful references in his articles concerning Soviet defectse spend-\ning and his \nin the last \nMy response \ndenigration of my views on Soviet military efforts \ntwenty years can only be characterized as ridiculous. \nto all of his criticisms is that \"he does not know \nwhat he is talking about.\" In the 1960's, I warned the proper . \nauthorities that the U.S.S.R. was going to try to achieve mili-\ntary superiority, and also warned about the dangers of detente \nand the provision of U.S. credit and technology to the Communist \ncountries. My warnings were meaningful because they were given \nahead of time. Mr. Navrozov's articles, however, are all mean-\ningless since they were given postfactum when the United States \nhad already made erroneous decisions which led to the loss of \ntheir military superiority. \nMr. Navrozov's attacks on Mr. Angleton, Mr. Hackett, Mr. \nArnaud de Borchgrave, Mr. Robert Moss, the British S.I.S., this \nauthor and many other experts on disinformation are not only \nirresponsible, but rather pretentious. I characterize this \noverall attack as grossly irresponsible because 'such persons as \nMessrs. Angleton, de Borchgrave and Moss have raised and brought \nconcern for the Communist disinformation issue and its impact \non the United States to the attention of the nation and to the \nWestern world. I find Mr. Navrozov's assertion that my book is \nuseful to the KGB, as most shocking and malicious. I am firmly \nconvinced that my book is the only realistic and timely presenta-\ntion which not only exposes the success of the Communist Strate-\ngic Disinformation Program, but also permits one to view the \nCommunist strategies in a new light. Further, the exposure in \nthe book creates serious obstacles for further Communist \nstrategic successes. My book has caught the Communist strate-\ngists, the KGB and their secret helpers red handed in mid stream \nof their preparation for a new strategic offensive in Europe. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n-5-\nI would like to make a summation of my impressions re-\ngarding Mr. Navrozov's articles. First, I seriously doubt that \nhe has an in-depth knowledge about the KGB, and whether he is \nat all qualified when he categorically dismisses the potential \nof the Bloc Intelligence System, and particularly, the Strate-\ngic Disinformation Program as it is directed against the West. \nThese are not minor issues since they involve the surviva:1 of \nthe United States. I believe that Mr. Navrozov has the duty \nto inform the public what his qualifications are that make him \nan authority on the KGB and on strategic disinformation. His \narticles contain so many inaccuracies and a complete disregard \nfor factual reporting that it appears that he does not compre-\nhend the high responsibility that accompanies reporting in the \nWestern world. His style is reminiscent of that of a fanatical \nreporter of a Communist provincial newspaper during the Stalin \nyears. His insinuations and assertions indicate that he, him-\nself, is under the spell of \"Communist Disinformation,\" and \nthat he is utterly confused by it. I feel that it would be \nuseless to argue the issues with Mr. Navrozov since he is \nobviously hopelessly confused and has closed his mind to reason \nBased on this, it appears that Mr. Navrozov is not a solution, \nbut a part of the problem. \nI am, however, concerned about the confusion which his \narticles may have generated in your readers and thus, would \nlike to share with them some of my views on the interaction \nbetween Communist strategies and strategic _disinformation. In \nmy opinion, if one understands the Communist strategies, one \nwill have an opportunity to detect, to understand, and to \nanalyze conciftte strategic disinformation operations, and to \nsee how they serve the strategies. Let me dwell for a few \nmoments on these concrete strategies and try to explain them, \nnot in academic terms as I did in my book, but in simple prag-\nmatic terms. There cannot be strategic disinformation in \ngeneral. One must first grasp the concrete strategy and then \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n- 6-\ndetermine what specific disinformation activities serve and con-\ntribute to the success of the strategy. First, for example, \nthere is the long range Communist policy for developinrmature \nsocialist societies and for achieving world domination. This \npolicy includes the military strategy of achieving the Communist \nBloc's military superiority through political-diplomatic negotia-\ntions with the United States and through the receipt of Western \nmilitary technology by the U.S.S.R. in the first phase, and by \nChina in the second phase. If one grasps this strategy, one \ncan better understand how its ultimate success is served by the \ndisinformation regarding the Sino-Soviet split. Second, another \n\"Communist strategy is its economic strategy whereby they strive \nto develop their economic-technical foundation so that it is \nsuperior to that of the West. This is to be accomplished with \nthe help of Western technology and with Western credit. It does \nnot require much wisdom to see that the success of the second \nstrategy is well served by the \"Rumanian Independence Disinforma-\ntion\" and again by the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation. \nThird, the European strategy is aimed at breaking up the \nNATO alliance and at the withdrawal of the United States forces \nfrom Europe through the German reunification and European securi-\nty. Taking this strategy into account, one can realize how well \nit may be served by Ceasescu's Independence Disinformation, by \nHonneker's raprochment with Western Germany and by the coming \nintroduction of false liberalization and the use of controlled \nopposition in Eastern Europe and in the U.S.S.R. \nFourth, another Communistf4(thi d world strategy)is aimed at \nthe elimination of Western influence in this area and the achieve-\nment of a United Front with the developing countries through the \nsupport of Wars of Liberation, by active diplomacy and by the use \nof a variety of tactics on the part of individual Communist \nstates instead of one tactic of a Communist monolith. If one \ntakes this strategy into account, one can see that the Sino-Soviet \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n\fApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029 \n- 7-\nSpilt Disinformation, in fact the duality of actions, and par-\nticularly, the disinformation of Tito 's independence, served \nthis strategy quite well. The late Tito almost succeeded in \ntaking these countries away from the West through the so-called \n\"Non-Aligned Movement.\" \nA few words regarding the solution of the problem are \nrequired. Since Communist Strategic Disinformation Operations \nare a product of the Communist strategists, i.e., man made, the \nclinical analysis of their technology should be man made as well. \nIn my view, this is a major task for Western governments and \ntheir intelligence and counter-intelligence services. Without a \nsolution of this task, one cannot expect either an understanding \nof Communist strategic disinformation in the West or a viable \nWestern policy toward the Communist world. \nThe conduct of Communist strategic disinformation operations \nand the confusion it generates are great obstacles for the success-\nful functioning of genuine political opposition in the Communist \ncountries and abroad. I have come to the conclusiQn that unless \nthe political opposition to the Communist regimes realizes the \ntrue essence of strategic disinformation and its connection with \ntheir strategies, they will make grave mistakes since they may be \nexploited skillfully by the Communist strategists and they, un-\nwittingly, may even serve the Communist strategists in achieving \ntheir goals. \nApproved for Release: 2018/04/10 C05259029"

A major \nthrust of this effort--often comprised of crude, blatantly \nemotional appeals--has been to portray the United States as a \npractitioner of terrorism and subversion and a violator of human \nrights. Moscow also works hard at fostering opposition to US \nmilitary bases and personnel overseas. The pace and scope of the \nUSSR's disinformation activities\ufffdwhich have produced some \nbenefits for Moscow\ufffdsuggest that the Soviets will continue to \n--ke advantage of opportunities, particularly in the Third World. \n(b)(3) \n(b)(3) \nThis memorandum was prepared by  Office of Global \nIssues.

The Soviets have continued their campaign of many \nyears that the United States is conspiring to destabilize foreign \ncountries, particularly in the Third World, by sponsoring coups, \nassassinating political leaders, and conducting a variety of \nother subversive activities. \no Shortly after the military coup in Fiji in May, Radio \nMoscow, TASS and Izvestia all began to play up rumors of \nUS involvement. On 18 May, for example, Radio Moscow \nreported a statement by the Soviet-controlled World Peace \nCouncil--which cited a leftist British newspaper--that \n\"former CIA Deputy Director\" Walters was in Fiji when the \nplot was being planned and that US citizens participated \nin the event. Moscow stepped up its disinformation \ncampaign on 1 June with a TASS story implicating the CIA \nand US Secret Service. This report was replayed the next \nday in Zimbabwe and on 3 June in Uruguay. \no Since the February 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime \nMinister Olof Palme, Moscow has made a concerted effort to \nimplicate the United States in his death. In addition to \nnumerous Soviet and Bloc press accounts alleging US \ncomplicity in Palme's murder, Moscow produced a television \ndocu-drama entitled \"Why Did They Kill 010 Palme?\" The \nfilm, shown this year in Sweden and the USSR, included \naccusations of CIA involvement in the shooting. \no The USSR also uses forgeries, rumors, anonymous mailings \nand other methods to conduct its disinformation campaign \nalleging CIA  plans to destabilize Third World  \ngovernments. \n(b)(1) \n(b)(3) \n  In addition, US Embassy \nindicates that the KGB: \nPlanted a rumor in the Congo this spring alleging \nthat Zairian President Mobutu intended to use the CIA \nto assassinate Congo President Sassou-Nguesso. \nCirculated last year in India, Pakistan, Peru, Guyana \nand several African countries an unattributed \npamphlet entitled \"CIA Insider\",  which named alleged \nCIA agents and officers.  (b)(3)  \nGI M 87-20122 \n(b)(3) \n2 (b)(3) \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f(1-11('11 \n--Approved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n3 LLISr.,44... \nHuman Rights Counteroffensive. Long sensitive to Western \ncriticism of its human rights record, Moscow has recently \nintensified its efforts to denigrate the performance of the West \non this issue. \no The Soviets this year issued a series of charges--based on \na book published by Novosti--claiming that the CIA \ninstigated the 1978 Jonestown massacre in order to prevent \n.cult members from emigrating to the Soviet Union. Since \nthe allegation was first publicized in the 30 January \nedition of Izvestia, it has been replayed in the pro-\nSoviet Indian press and in the Communist press of Uruguay \nand East Germany. Moreover, the Novosti book has been \nreviewed in the Finnish and Danish press, thereby adding \ncredibility to the story. \no The publicity given in Soviet Bloc media and in Soviet \ndisinformation outlets overseas, leads us to believe that \nMoscow is behind a recent campaign alleging US trafficking \nin Central American children for the purpose of using them \nin organ transplant operations. This campaign appears to \nhave considerable momentum: Since the beginning of the \nyear, these charges have appeared not only in Soviet, \nCuban, Nicaraguan and Yugoslav media, but also in the \npress of the Dominican Republic, France, Guatemala, \nHonduras and India. \no In an effort to exploit the apartheid issue, the USSR is \ncontinuing to push allegations--begun in the early 1980s--\nthat the United States and South Africa are conducting \nresearch on a so-called ethnic weapon--a biological weapon \ndesigned to kill people selectively on the basis of \nrace. Radio Moscow again charged in February, for \nexample, that the ethnic bor.' (3) \n(b) \ufffdluld kill blacks but \"leave  \nout the white race.\" \nTargeting the US Military. The Soviets also have an \naggressive disinformation program targeting the US military \npresence overseas. \no In our view, a central element of this effort is Moscow's \nworldwide campaign, begun in October 1985, charging that \nAIDS is the result of US biological warfare experiments. \nDuring the past several months the USSR has repeatedly \nused the AIDS story as a means of heightening opposition \nto US military bases, troops, and port access rights \naround the globe: \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f\"'Approved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \nJI-A0M,U\ufffd \nIn February, a Ukrainian paper claimed that the \nJapanese were panicking over the spread of AIDS by US \nservicemen in Japan and that restaurants, barber \nshops, and other businesses near US bases had barred \nAmericans from entering. \nWe suspect the Soviets were responsible for a forged \npress release surfaced in May in West Berlin in which \na city health official purportedly announced that the \nUS Army hospital there was overflowing with AIDS \nvictims. \no Moscow has also surfaced allegations that some existing US \nmilitary facilities will be used in the Strategic Defense \nInitiative (SDI) program and that the United States is \nattempting to acquire new bases in order to destabilize \nparticular regions: \n- In March the Indian press ran an article on Soviet. \ncharges--attempting to play upon regional sensitivity \nabout military use of Diego Garcia--that the United \nStates produced SDI components there. \n- Soviet radio charged in April that joint US-Zaire \nmilitary maneuvers reflected a US interest in using \nthe Kamina air force base \n(b)(3) thern Zaire to \ndestabilize the region. \nIn our view, several trends charcterize recent Soviet \ndisinformation activity. \no The Soviets are persistent. In pushing a given theme, \nSoviet disinformation specialists apparently believe that \nrepetition of even the most unbelievable stories pays off \nin the long run. Indeed, Soviet charges that AIDS was \ndeveloped at Fort Detrick have been replayed in the press \nof over 60 countries. In April these allegations appeared \nin the official Indian armed forces journal \"Sainik \nSamachar.\" \no The Soviets seize on opportunities quickly. Within three \ndays after the coup in Fiji, for example, Radio Moscow, \nIzvestia, and TASS all carried stories implying US \ninvolvement. \no Moscow targets much of its disinformation toward Third \nWorld audiences. During the past year, we have seen a \nconcerted Soviet effort--in part through forgeries and \ndisinformation--to intensify anti-US sentiment within the \nNonaligned Movement, whose criticism of the United States \nand backing of many Soviet positions Moscow believes is a \nmajor political asset. There is also evidence that the \nSoviets are working hard to exploit growing political and \n(b)(3) \nApproved for Release: 2017/09/13 C05798947 \n\f--Approved for Release: 201'7109/1 3 C05798947 \nS \neconomic tensions in southern Africa, using forgeries as \ntheir primary vehicle. Through this mechanism, Moscow has \nalleged US coup plotting against several black African \nstates; US-South African cooperation; and US circumvention \nof the arms embargo against South Africa. \no Soviet disinformation is often crude. Despite glasnost at \nhome and an increasingly sophisticated use of propaganda \nand public diplomacy, much Soviet disinformation continues \nto be comprised of crude, blatantly emotional appeals. As \nevidenced by the AIDS and baby trafficking campaigns, \nMoscow is apparently convinced that this approach can be \neffective, particularly in the Third World. \no The level of activity appears to be increasing. While \ndifficult to gauge, the level of Soviet disinformation \nactivity appears to be on the rise, as evidenced by the \nnumber of known or suspected Soviet forgeries that have \npublicly surfaced in the past 18 months. Typically in the \npast we have seen about 10-15 of such forgeries each year, \nbut for the 1986-87 eriod we are seein a rate of Ahout  \n20 per year. (W(1) \n(b)(3) \nAlthough the impact of Soviet disinformation cannot be \nmeasured precisely, we believe Moscow has reaped some benefits. \no US officials have been forced to protest a barrage of \n.anti-US AIDS disinformation stories throughout the Third \nWorld. \no In India, where Moscow's most common theme alleges that \nthe United States is conspiring to destabilize the country \nby supporting the Sikh and other separatist movements, \nIndians overwhelmingly believe that Washington is the \nsingle largest promoter of international terrorism, \naccording to public opinion data from 1985. \no According to press reporting, the ousted prime minister of \nFiji said in a June interview in Washington that he had \n\"strong suspicions\" of US involvement in the coup and \ncalled for a Congressional inquiry. \no Moscow's anti-CIA program--particularly the lists of \nalleged CIA officers and agents--has intimidated and cast \nsuspicion on many people. For example, the US Embassy in \nKinshasa reports that an editor of a Zairean newspaper who \nwas a contact of USIS feared that the government's \nsecurity service would interrogate him afterhis name \nappeared on a list of CIA agents.

Action required:  None.  This memorandum, which reports on the\n outcome of the 25-27 June Conference on Contemporary Soviet Propaganda and\n Disinformation (CSPD), is for information only.\n Conference Results\n 2.  In practical terms, the conference produced much new evidence on the\n problem of disinformation, although not as much as hoped for, perhaps, on the\n semantic dimension per se.  Thirteen formal papers were prepared, and\n approximately 21 hours of discussion exist on tape.  Overall, the quality of\n the papers, oral presentations, and general discussions is quite high--\n probably the result of the participants' having been informed that some sort\n of conference proceedings would be published.  (How this will be accomplished\n is discussed below.)\n 3.  As you know, one of the primary purposes of the conference was to\n highlight the problem that we face in recognizing disinformation's various\n guises. In this regard, the conference was very successful.  The academic\n papers, especially the case studies, focused attention on specific\n manifestations of the problem.  This forced the audience, as well as the\n authors, to identify and recognize various forms of disinformation.  Perhaps\n even more useful, however, was the testimony--sometimes written, but more\n often off-the-cuff--of participating Soviet and East European defectors and\n emigres, whose accounts of their \"hands-on\" experience helped considerably to\n bring home the reality of disinformation's forms and techniques.  In fact, the\n conference was unique in bringing together such a large number of these ex-\n Soviets with academics and government specialists.  This compositional mix\n produced a good exchange of views and experiences.\n STAT\n ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n SUBJECT:  Follow-up to Disinformation Conference\n 4.  At the same time, the conference produced no consensus on the need\n for Western scholars to deal directly with the issue of disinformation in\n their work.  Indeed, the conference's final session reflected some marked\n differences of view among academics on this score.  Some argued the need not\n only to examine closely the \"ambiguity and contradictoriness\" of Soviet\n policy, but to take a \"moral\" position in doing so.  Others, while recognizing\n that disinformation is a significant factor in creating this \"ambiguity and\n contradictoriness,\" were clearly resistant to this notion, appearing to equate\n a \"moral\" position with a \"political\" one.\n 5.  These differences apparently reflected differing philosophical views\n as outlined by Norman Podhoretz in his keynote address. on the causes of\n Western vulnerability to semantic manipulation.  Despite this, the\n participants appeared to agree fully on the need for the government to\n neutralize and counter Soviet disinformation--primarily through greater\n efforts at consciousness-raising among the media and the public.\n Follow-up Steps\n 6.  In organizing the conference, we made clear that some sort of\n publication would result, and without exception all the conference\n participants strongly supported this intention.  We have considered publishing\n a simple compilation of the formal papers but decided that too much valuable\n information and analysis--especially that provided by the defectors--would be\n lost.  We therefore are having the taped proceedings transcribed as quickly as\n possible in order to prepare a conference report that includes synopses of the\n numerous oral presentations and discussions.  The report will be given broad\n dissemination by the State Department.\n 7.  A number of the conferees suggested that a list of participants would\n be useful to keep each other informed and to involve each other in related\n work as time passes.  Some saw this as a first step in helping to create a\n network of specialists interested in disinformation issues.  Accordingly, we\n have sent such a list (excluding the names of CIA staffers except me) to the\n conference participants.\n 8.  Another suggestion that many conferees made at the conference and in\n subsequent correspondence was to have a follow-up conference examine possible\n countermeasures.  A small sample of this correspondence is attached (including\n an earlier letter from Aaron Levenstein proposing the creation of a privately\n funded Center for Propaganda Research).\n 2\n ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY\n Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n\f Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/19: CIA-RDP89GO1126R000100100009-9\n SUBJECT:  Follow-up to Disinformation Conference\n 9.

He\n spent his last two years in Prague\n directing a team of disinformation\n specialists who held freewheeling\n discussions, similar to those of\n Madison Avenue advertising agents,\n that led to disinformation proposals.\n \"It was public relations in\n reverse,\" Mr. Bittman said.\n Although he ended his intelli-\n enRe- career in 1968 after bein\n e    e   y U.S. intelligence ser-\n vices, Mr. Bittman said he continues\n to recognize Soviet disinformation\n programs in the U.S. press.\n Mr. Bittman defended the U.S.\n press for its critical judgment but\n added: 'As a former specialist, I\n would say there are a number of\n journalists in the American media\n that were recruited by the Soviets\n who work either for various\n prominent newspapers or for\n broadcast news media:' Mr. Bittman\n said.\n Agents in the media are asked to\n report stories based on outlines pro-\n vided by Soviet case officers. Usu-\n ally, planted stories publicize items\n that will damage U.S. foreign policy\n or a particularly anti-Soviet public\n figure, he said.\n He said the Soviets \"love forger-\n ies\" and used hundreds of forged\n documents against the West during\n the 1960s and early 1970s. In the\n mid-1970s, reports of forgeries\n declined because during the\n Watergate scandal forgeries prob-\n ably were considered counterpro-\n ductive, he said.\n Since the late 1970s, however, the\n Soviets have stepped up their use of\n forgeries, he said.\n One example of a KGB forgery'\n was a letter criticizing black athletes\n that was sent to Third World coun-\n tries just before the 1984 Olympic\n Games in Los Angeles. The letter\n purportedly was sent by the Ku Klux\n Klan but was identified by the FBI\n as a fake.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/10/10: CIA-RDP90-00965R000302330043-7"

Casey sounded the\n alarm in September when he devoted one of his relatively\n rare public speeches to a description of the \"active meas-\n ures\" being employed by the KGB to subvert public opin-\n ion. Casey warned especially about \"disinformation\" -\n the planting by the Soviets of \"half-truths, lies, and rumors\n to discredit free-world policies or individuals.\" Disinfor-\n mation campaigns, Casey added, \"are projected and rein-\n forced by media manipulation. The Soviets conduct a\n massive worldwide effort to manipulate foreign media, thus\n transforming portions of the press into an unwitting prop-\n aganda machine.\"\n The main point of Casey's remarks was that Americans\n should brace themselves for an all-out disinformation assault\n on the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly\n known as Star Wars. Casey predicted \"a propaganda cam-\n paign likely to assume unprecedented proportions\" as the\n Soviets give \"high priority\" to mobilizing opposition to\n SDI \"among our allies and in our country.\"\n While Casey stopped short of suggesting that the KGB\n had recruited American journalists for its disinformation\n efforts. a Voice of America employee. Lisa Jameson. ar-\n ticulated just this suspicion in an October talk at Stanford\n University. Citing as her source two Soviet defectors who\n had posed as journalists while working for the KGB, Jame-\n son said the KGB may have hundreds of recruited agents\n among foreign journalists, including some in the United\n States, who are ''ready at any time to place prepared stories\n in their national media.\" Editor & Publisher was so per-\n turbed by this possibility that in a November 2 editorial it\n suggested it might be time \"we went back to attaching labels\n to stories that might be suspect as to their origins and facts. \"\n At the same time, readers of the Los Angeles Times were\n given reason to suspect that they had been the victims of\n \"active measures\" by the KGB. Richard Sybert. a special\n assistant to the secretary of defense, wrote in a letter to the\n Times. published on November 2, that a basically critical\n series on the Strategic Defense Initiative by Times reporter\n Robert Scheer \"was a masterpiece of disinformation.\"\n Complaining about a \"flood of pre-summit disinformation\n on the SDI, Sybert attacked Scheer and others for \"com-\n pletely false\" statements, \"myth,\" and \"fabrication.\"\n In a recent interview, Sybert said that he had not intended\n to accuse Scheer of disinformation in the sense of the term\n as used within the intelligence community. Rather, he had\n used \"disinformation\" to mean the use of factually wrong\n information, \"some of which does come from the Soviets.\"\n by \"people who either know it's wrong or who haven't\n done their homework.\" Scheer, said Sybert. had used straw\n men and red herrings to \"very skillfully present a bunch of\n alleged facts and disinform people.\" Sybert went on to say\n that he \"in no way intended to suggest that Scheer was an\n agent of Soviet propaganda, although this sort of thing lends\n itself to this purpose.\"\n Certainly, the Soviets are out to undermine the president's\n missile-defense initiative; just as certainly, many Americans\n - including scores of reputable scientists - are alarmed\n by the president's plan. The press has an obligation to do\n its own digging on the issue and to report all sides of the\n debate, including what critics - both foreign and domestic\n - have to say.\n U.S. officials have obligations, too. If they are going to\n allege a massive anti-SDI disinformation campaign aimed\n at the press by the KGB, they should take care not to make\n indiscriminate allegations of disinformation when that term\n has become virtually synonymous with intelligence activity\n And they should not regard agreement with Soviet views\n as a Soviet propaganda triumph. Such simplistic thinking\n can lead to hizarre conclusions.\n Take, for instance. Casey's assertion that a prime So-\n viet disinformation objective is to \"encourage Eu-\n ropean and American antinuclear groups to view the\n SDI program as threatening an increase in the nuclear arms\n race when, in fact, it promises the opposite.\" If the notion\n that SDI might spur the arms race is to be equated w ith\n Soviet propaganda, what is one to conclude about a passage\n in Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's pre-summit re-\n port to the president' In that report, a copy of which was\n leaked to the press. Weinberger warned that \"even a pr oh-\n able territorial [Soviet missilel defense would require us to\n increase the number of our offensive forces and their ability\n to penetrate Soviet defenses to assure that our operational\n plans could be executed.\" Surely the same logic applies in\n the case of a U.S. missile-defense system.\n Disinformation, evidently, can lurk in the unlikeliest\n places. Meanwhile, in-depth coverage of the debate over\n SDI would seem to be the best antidote to whatever dis-\n information Soviet intelligence agents might be trying to\n sneak into the U.S. press.\n Gilbert Cranbere tras editorial page editor of The Des Moines\n Register from 1975 to /982. he now teaches journalism at the\n University of Iowa.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/01/20: CIA-RDP90-00965R000200990021-2"

Dr. Shults,  good morning.\n Dr.  Shultz,  as I just men,tior.eu, we've said that there are\n lies, half-truths, planted stories and so forth under this\n umbrella of disinformation.   Specifically, give us an\n example of something, would you?   RICHARD SHULTZ:   Well,\n an example could be an agent of influence.   Disinformation\n is a whole range of political arid propaganda techniques,\n what we call influence techniques, that are used to try to\n affect politics in'another country.   Especially they're\n used against major adversaries.   So the objective would be\n to try to undermine the political leadership of a major\n adversary like the United States,  to undermine the\n institutions, to influence the policies, to split the\n United States from its allies.   And so for  20 years,  for\n example, the Soviets ran, a major campaign and it's still\n going today to atteZpt  to split the United States from its\n NATO allies.\n HARTMAN:   How big an operation is this in the Soviet\n Union?   SHULTZ:   It's a big operation..   They have a number\n of key bureaucratic elements that are involved, including\n the KGB and the international department,  but the\n important thing is that it extends well beyond the Soviet\n Union, wi,ere you finu in the West many agents and\n intelligence officers and even diplomats.\n HARTMAN:   What about here?

I find it extraordinary\n that we should give equal time\n to people who have been\n trained in the basic Leninist\n precepts, which hold that to tell\n the truth is a dirty bourgeois\n habit. For a revolutionary to lie\n and to' lie convincingly is not\n only a sign of intelligence, but\n imperative when furthering a\n revolutionary cause. How can\n you give equal time to people\n who believe that to tell the\n truth is stupid?\n USA TODAY: Why did you\n write The Spike? Was it be-\n cause some of your stories\n were spiked?\n George Shultz repeated this re-\n cently, he was not laughed out\n of court The evidence is now\n overwhelming and irrefutable.\n It's amazing that it takes years\n for these perceptions to pene-\n trate in America when they\n have been penetrating in Eu-\n rope for years.\n DeBORCHGRAVE: We now\n have a scholarly work, Dezin-\n formatsia, written by two Dem-\n ocrats, Richard Shultz of the\n Fletcher School of Law and Di-\n plomacy and Roy Godson of\n Georgetown University. They\n confirm that the Soviets are\n spending $3 billion to $4 billion\n a year on disinformation oper-\n ations in the Western media.\n USA TODAY: Do American\n journalists agree that disin-\n formation is a problem?\n De BORCHGRAVE: Until re-\n cently, the notion was pooh-\n poohed by the entire profes-\n sion. Many editors said that the\n American media were run by.\n people who were far too astute\n to allow anything so crass as\n Soviet disinformation.\n USA TODAY: But you think\n disinformation efforts In the\n USA are extensive?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: It's all-\n pervasive and all-intrusive. I\n think it is extraordinary that\n the editors of major American\n newspapers still reject that as-\n sertion and have the notion\n that if disinformation does go\n on, it doesn't go on in their pa-\n pers. Yet, you can actually spot\n it in their papers all the time.\n What do you call it then? Is it\n sheer ignorance?\n USA TODAY: How do they\n respond when it Is brought to\n their attention?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: Oh, yes.\n I had very important stories\n spiked. One was May 11, 1978,\n which was a French intelli-\n gence secret report document-\n ing the links between the. KGB\n and international terrorist\n groups operating in Western\n Europe. I flew to the United\n States on the Concorde with\n that story because it was too\n sensitive to be sent by telex.\n Things started getting unglued\n after a couple of hours. The sto-\n ry got shot down by people who\n simply could not believe that\n these kinds of things were go-\n ing on under the umbrella of\n detente.\n USA TODAY: Has the Euro-\n pean press been more open\n about disinformation?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: Yes, far\n more open. What was rejected\n by my editors as utter non-\n sense in 1978 has just been pub-\n lished by two people in a book\n called Terrorism: The Soviet\n Connection. Alexander Haig,\n when he first became secre-\n tary of state, went public with\n the accusation that much of the\n terrorism today is aided, abet-\n ted, and funded by the Soviets\n and their countries. He was\n laughed out of the court by the\n mass media, which dismissed\n it as Cold War rhetoric. When\n USA TODAY: How do you\n feel about that?\n DeBORCHGRAVE: It terri-\n fies me. I can't believe we are\n that naive. In many instances,\n we are terminally naive, which\n is more dangerous than suffer-\n ing from terminal cancer.\n Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/12/21: CIA-RDP90-00965R000100260015-0"

I requested and was granted asylum in \norder to become an active participant in the struggle against co=unism \nand the KGB. Specifically my intent was to warn the United States govern-\nment about the new communist political and strategic threats resulting \nfrom KGB penetrations in the western governments and further to help \nthem in counteracting these threats.

I also resent the title which he gave to this article, \n-When the CIA Was Almost Wrecked\". In truth, it is necessary to state \nthat my disclosures did not damage these three major services. The \ndamage was effected by the KGB. by disclosures 'should be regarded as \nimportant contributions in revealing and neutralizing the KGB penetrat-\nions in the western services. The circumstances of history and my \npersonal knowledge of the KGB have put me in the position of a diag-\nnostician in discovering the penetrations in these services and in \nthe position of a doctor in helping to cure the malady.

Subsequent developments confirmed my predictions \nand warnings and for the first time penetrations and disinformation \nwere recognized as serious problems to be confronted.The validity of \nmy warnings about KGB penetrations was further confirmed by the \nnumerous indications of KGB successes. As you are aware KGB penetrationE \nhave now become an almost daily occurrence as evidenced by the recent \nKGB recruitment of a FBI Special Agent.I have played a significant role \nin eliminating KGB penetrations from the services of three major western \ncountries and in restoring their effectiveness. The extent of my \ncontribution cannot be fully judged by outsiders or by retired intell-\nigence officers.Only senior officers of the western intelligence \nservices are in a position to make such a judgment. I am especially \nproud of my contributions and my efforts. Without them some western \nservices would have remained penetrated and would have suffered \nirreparable losses including the total compromise of a number of their \nofficers and secret agents. I am convinced that my efforts would have \nbeen much more effective, viv-a-vis the American Services had it not \nbeen for the Watergate crisis.

Div. of JAYCOR \n205 South Whiting Street \nAlexandria, Va. 22304 \nDear Mr. Douglass Jr.: \nI wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation \nfor your review of my book, \"New Lies for Old\". Your review \nindeed shows a genuine concern for the subject of \"Strategic \nDisinformation \" and the failure of the West to deal witth it. \nI am impressed by your credentials and I agree that we have a \ncommon interest here. However, I am of the opinion that a dis-\ncussion, at the present time, would not be very fruitful. I am \npresently drafting a new book which, in some ways, is an exten-\nsion of \"New Lies for Old'. It will deal, inter alia, with the \ntechnology of disinformation. I am using my own methodology and \nresearch which will require clearance by the proper American author-\nities. Therefore, I would like to postpone your proposed discussion \nuntil I finish this new book. \nI would like, however, to make a few comments regarding your \nreview. I concur with your comment that the book is somewhat diff-\nicult to read. This is quite natural since the book is an academic \none.In fact most books on this subject, including articles such as \nyours, are difficult to read. As for the structure of the book, I \nmust explain that the original manuscript was very_IongconSiSting \nof three volumes. Volume one dealt with the struggle for power after \nthe death of Stalin and the adoption of the Soviet Bloc's long range \ngrand policy. (1953-1960.) Volume two dealt with Strategic Disinform-\nation . Volume three discussed the Communist strategies in detail. \nBecause of its length I compromised with my publisher to publish \nonly the second volume as \"New Lies for Old', since it was the \nmost important subject and the least known. Since it was taken out \nof context, both the logic and the credibility of the book was \nweakened: Volume one and volume three are being held in abeyance \nby the publisher awaiting their chances. I am convinced, however, \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \nthat they are not only important but that they are absolutely \nnecessary background reading in order to fully understand the \nsubject of \"Strategic Disinformaion\", as described in \"New Lies \nfor Old\". \nAs a gesture of my good will and my trust in you, I wish to state \nthat, if you are interested in reading the two unprinted volumes, I \ncan arrange it with the publisher to have them made available to you \nfor reading. Unfortunately, by agreement, this would have to be \neffected only in the New York offices of the publisher. I do believe \nthat such a reading would be most beneficial and it would keep our ties \nalive. Unfortunately, all correspondence on this matter, for security \nreasons, must be through the Dodd, Mead Publishing Company. \nSincerely, \nA.

Golitsyn To The Participants Of The Conference \nOn \"Disinformation In The Modern World\". \nGentlemen: \nI am indeed grateful for the invitation to participate in the \nconference on \"Disinformation In The Modern World\". Unfortunately \nI am unable to attend and personally participate. However, as a \nperson greatly concerned about this subject, I would like to \noffer for your consideration several points on \"Disinformation\" which \nare particularly relevant to your organization and to the political \nopposition in general. \n1) I am alarmed by the confusion on the subject of \"Disinformation\" \nMany people talk about it and write about it providing their own \ndefinitions of the word. I am of the opinion that these erroneous \ndefinitions and interpretations of communist disinformation are the \nprinciple causes for this wide-spread confusion.Some writers confuse \ndisinformation with limited covert operations and political action, \ndiscounting its long range strategic connection. Others confuse it \nwith propaganda and psychological warfare. We often speak about \ndisinformation in general terms lumping together strategic, political, \nmilitary, operational and tactical disinformation. All of this confusion \nin my view, can be eliminated or at least reduced, by giving a more \nconcrete and precise definition of \"Communist Strategic Disinformation\". \nMy definition of \"Communist Strategic Disinformation\", is as follows: \n\"Those secret operations or activities which are conducted by the \nentire Communist Bloc or by a number of its members in accordance \nwith a consistent design or a strategic plan to create favorable \nconditions for long range communist grand policies and strategies and \nto contribute to the success of these policies and strategies. \nThe essence of such operations is an active misrepresentation of \nthe true communist principle goals and strategies in order to \naccomplish them by influencing and inducing their western adversaries \nto contribute, albeit unwittingly, to the accomplishment of their \nobjectives. Such active misrepresentation is performed by the con-\ncealment of true information and by the calculated distortion and \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n2 \ndissemination of false information sometimes detrimental to them-\nselves and contradictory to their own propaganda. The communist \ncomponents involved include the Party, Assets of its Security and \nIntelligence Services, the controlled political opposition, Agents \nof influence inside and abroad, the communist press and their agents \nin place in the Western Media like in Pathe in France. \n2) Communist leaders including diplomats like Minister Gromyko \nand Ambassador Dobrynin, prominent scientists and writers all play \nan active role in this operation. Often the KGB and the Defense \nMinistries of Communist Countries, such as the USSR and China, conduct \nspecial supportive actions like faked border hostilities or public \nprotests in front of their respective embassies. \n3) The more exact definition of Strategic Disinformation, if \nunderstood, provides an opportunity to detedt, to understand and to \nanalyze concrete strategic disinformation operations and to see \nhow they serve the strategies. Let me dwell for a few moments on these \nconcrete stategies and try to explain them, not in academic terms \nas I did in my book, \"New Lies For Old\", but in simple pragmatic terms \nThere cannot be strategic disinformation in general. One must first \ngrasp the concrete strategy and then determine what specific dis-\ninformation activities serve and contribute to the success of the \nstrategy.For example there is thelong range communist policy for \ndeveloping mature socialist societies and for achieving world dominatior \nThis policy includes the military strategy of achieving the Communists \nBloc's military superiority through political-diplomatic negotiations \nwith the United States and through the receipt of western military \ntechnology by the USSR in the first phase and by China in the second \nphase. If one grasps this strategy one can better understand how its \nultimate success is served by the disinformation regarding the \nSino-Soviet split. \n4) Another communist strategy is its economic strategy whereby \nthey strive to develop their ecomonic-technical foundation so that \nit is superior to that of the west .This to be accomplished with \nthe help of western\nAlpP'r-olVed-f'orkeiea-se:-'2026/03/09 005259030cred1t . It does not \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n3 \nrequire much wisdom to see that the success of the second strategy is \nwell served by the \"Romanian Independence Disinformation\" and again \nby the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation. \n5) The European strategy is aimed at breaking up the NNTO \nalliance and at the withdrawal of United States forces from Europe \nthrough the German reunification and European security. Taking this \nstrategy into account one can realize how well it may be served by \nCeasescu's Independence Disinformation, by Honneker's raprochment \nwith Western Germany and by the coming introduction of the false \nliberalization and the use of controlled opposition in Eastern \nEurope. \n6) Another Communist third world strategy is aimed at the \nelimination of western influence in this area and the achievement \nof a United Front with the developing countries through the support \nof Wars of Liberation, by active diplomacy and by the use of a \nvariety of tactics on the part of individual communist states instead \nof one tactic of a communist monolith.If one takes this strategy into \naccount one can see that the Sino-Soviet Split Disinformation, in \nfact the duality of actions, and particularly the Disinformation of \nTito's independence, served this strategy quite well. The late Tito \nalmost succeeded in taking these countries away from the west through \nthe so called \"Non-alligned Movement\". \n7) Since Communist Strategic Disinformation Operations are a \nproduct of the communist strategists ie man made, the clinical \nanalysis of their technology should be man made as well. In my view \nthis is a major task for western governments and their intelligence \nand counter-intelligence services. Without a solution of this task \none cannot expect either an understanding of communist strategic \ndisinformation in the west or a viable western policy toward the \ncommunist world. \n8) The conduct of communist strategic disinformation operations \nand the confusion it generates are big obstacles for the successful \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n\fApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030 \n4 \nfunctioning of genuine political opposition in the communist countries \nand abroad. I have come to the conclusion that unless the political \nopposition to the communist regimes realize the true essence of \nstrategic disinformation and its connection with their stategies, they \nwill make grave mistakes since they may be exploited skillfully by the \ncommunist strategists and they ,unwittingly, may even serve the \ncommunist strategists in achieving their goals. \nI have to be frank with you. I am concerned by your stated plans. \nAfter reading your, Statement of Principle, I have reached the con-\nclusion that your organization is moving in the wrong direction and \nthat you already may have made a big mistake. In your statement you stat \nthat you are trying to create and function as a United Front to fight \nagainst the Soviet totalitarianisms and against the military regimes \nimplying in the non-communist world as well. I fund this not only \nerroneous but also confusing and contrdictory. Why is it necessary \nfor you to combine two struggles? Why not limit your efforts to an \neffective struggle against the Soviet, Chinese, Polish, Cuban, \nCzechoslovakian, Romanian, North Korean and the rest of the communist \ntotalitarianisms as the main threats to the non-communist world \nand leave the other military dictatorships or regimes to the oppor-\ntunities of the democratic processes there and to the influence of \nother western governments and particularly to the quiet diplomacy of \nthe United States as verbalized by the American representative to \nthe United Nations, Ms. Jean Kirkpatrick. It appears that your plan to \nfight the military regimes, if applied to Latin America and Central \nAmerica, might put your organization in conflict with United States \npolicy in these areas. You may also find yhat your efforts to fight the \nmilitary dictatorships in these areas might be exploited by the Soviets \nwho support the struggle for liberation. Thus you may find that un-\nwittingly you are serving Soviet strategic plans. \nI sincerely hope that the foregoing on the threat of communist \nstrategic disinformation will assist you in understanding the danger \ninvolved in your United Front of two struggles and in making the \nnecessary corrections. Thank you for your attention and consideration. \nSincerely, \nApproved for Release: 2020/03/09 C05259030,1 1t cvn \n\fApproved for Rle: 2020/03109 C052590\neeas .su \nTRANSMITTAL SLIP \nDATE \nTO: C\")...e.._ \nROOM \nBU ING \n-1NO. \n1 \nREMARKS: \nCfi \n0 ...\" \nFROM: \nROOM NO. \nBUI DING \nEXTENSION \nFORM NO. \n1 FEB 55 \n241 \nREAA.CES FORM 36-8 \n\"I MAY BE \nW\" USED. \n(4T) \n`-- OPleasel 20201009 CO5259030"
