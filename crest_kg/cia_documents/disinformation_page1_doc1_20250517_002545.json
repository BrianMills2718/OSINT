The CIA denied\n it.  And President  Reagan also denied government      involvement, but\n he  admitted  the White House did know about private American help\n to the Contras.\n PRESIDENT  REAGAN:    We've  been  aware   that  there  are\n private  groups and private  citizens  that  have  been trying to help\n the  Contras,  to  that  extent.    But  we  did not   know  the  exact\n particulars of what they're doing.\n COLLINGS:    Some critics  on  Capitol  Hill thought    the\n Administration knew    a  lot  more than that.\n SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY:  The Administration  is skating   on\n the knife-edge of credibility.\n COLLINGS:    I'm Anthony Collings  in Washington.   Welcome\n to Newsmaker Saturday.\n Credibility  is    once again  an  issue.   Critics  find it\n hard to believe when     the   Administration says  the Iceland meeting\n OFFICES IN: WASAHIfMroved T.C For i RNEIeiVI -a YORK ?\n LOS ANGELES ? CHICAGO ?

Wasn't  there a disinformation campaign?\n SENATOR  WILLIAM              COHEN:    Well,  first  let me  be very\n clear.   The committee itself did not make an investigation.            The\n Chairman  of the Intelligence Committee,         Dave Durenberger,  and the\n chief of staff,  Bernie McMahon,          made an inquiry.   And        they were\n satisfied  there         had been  no,    quote,   official    campaign for\n disinformation.  Which   is  not   the    same   as saying       that stories did\n not   leak  into the   press  or  were  not         deliberately leaked  by\n certain     individuals that  may         have  planted  false  stories  or\n misleading stories.      But     there    was   no evidence,  according  to\n their inquiry, of an  official campaign          orchestrated and organized\n by     the White House.\n COLLINGS:   But  the White House spokesman,  Larry     Speakes,\n used the word \"authoritative,\" referring  to  the         story,         as  if  it\n were deliberate and     intentional,      not just...\n SENATOR COHEN:   I     think  there  were  individuals   within\n the  State Department,       perhaps  in  other  facets of the White House\n operation,  of  individuals   who indeed  did believe    it  was  important\n to     try  and  disseminate  information       that might  keep   Qaddafi,\n quote, off  balance.    I    think  that  they  now recognize  the  dangers\n in  using,  in any way,      the U.S.  media to convey   information which\n is patently      false.\n COLLINGS:   Admiral Turner,  do you agree that  there is        a\n danger  in  this, or  do you  feel  that  it's  a  good  thing?\n ADMIRAL  STANSFIELD        TURNER:    Oh, I think disinformation\n can be used quite to  our  advantage  and  it's       a  good  thing  to    do\n from  time  to  time.    But  on  the     one   extreme, you  can      have  a\n disinformation program that    disinforms  only  one      person.       And  I\n could cite  an  actual   case        that  I participated in   where     we did\n that  very  effectively  for  our country.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:  Can you cite that case?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Yes. We tried to get  the ambassador   of\n a foreign country,     who was democratically inclined,  to go back to\n his  country  and  engage  in  a  dispute  that  was  going  on  in  the\n government  about  whether it  should be  moved to the  left.    And  we\n disinformed  this  ambassador  about  his        own  status in  his own\n country,    and he went home to take care of his      own problem, and we\n got  him    into the  fray  in fighting for the   democratic side.   It\n was a very useful thing.   Didn't happen     to win,  but        nonetheless\n we  disinformed him    and  he did  do what we wanted him  to do.\n COLLINGS:  Are you saying you lied?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: Yes,  we lied    to him   and we made this\n man believe something was going  on that    affected him  in     his home\n country     that  was  not  going  on.   But we  got  him  back  into the\n fray,  so to speak.\n On  the  other  extreme,     you can  disinform  the  whole\n American      public,  or   the  whole  world,  practically.      And in\n thiscase,  the Administration      was  insensitive to the       degree which\n they   were    moving away  from  a   single disinformation  to  a  very\n broad  disinformation.\n COLLINGS:   Arnaud de Borchgrave,    the Soviet Union has a\n campaign of disinformation,      as we  know.         Aren't  we stooping to\n their  level when we    do the  same  thing?\n ARNAUD  DE   BORCHGRAVE:   Well,  first,  I       have to make a\n correction       about the  Wall  Street     Journal  story.     It was\n authoritative.       As  a  matter of   fact,   what  was happening  in\n Tripoli at that      time was a meeting with President Assad of Syria;\n Ghebril     (?),  a  well-known  Palestinian  terrorist;         Abu Moussa,\n another well-known Palestinian terrorist; the head        of the Iranian\n Revolutionary  Guards.      And French counterintelligence  happens  to\n know  that     they  were  at that very moment plotting some terrorist\n actions in Western Europe.\n COLLINGS:      But we  know that  Poindexter  talked  about\n Qaddafi being quiescent.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He was not  quiescent.   There was...\n COLLINGS:      Whatever reports there  were,  they  weren't\n clear that he was planning new terrorism.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Because we  in  the  media  were  not doing\n our  job.   They  put  out   a statement,  the Libyan news  agency -- I\n don't  know  why  we didn't pick  it  up.  They   said,  \"We  are setting\n up     special  revolutionary --  secret   revolutionary cells  in many\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n Western     countries  in  order to launch attacks against America          in\n such  a  way   that they  will  not  be  able  to  retaliate  with       their\n aircrft     carriers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"            This\n was a direct quote     from the Libyan news agency.\n He  was  not  quiescent.   But  again,  that's conventional\n wisdom right  away,   he was quiescent.\n As  for  the  Soviet Union,  you know that  they spend three\n to   four   bil-l,ion  d ollars  a  year an  active  measures,           which\n encompasses all    forms  of disinformation.   We have printed as         fact\n in  our media countless Soviet      forgeries. And  I could              spend  the\n next two hours reciting them from memory.\n COLLINGS:  Well,  don't  do that,  because we want  to talk\n about American disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   We    don't  get  involved in that.   We do\n not  plant  disinformation  in our  own    media.   As the Admiral       said,\n abroad  there are some disinformation       operations that go on.         But\n let's make quite clear that there is a major  difference               between\n strategic deception,  which we were involved in against Qaddafi to\n destabilize him,      psych him,  psychological  warfare;        and       all that\n was  indeed           going  on, and for  a  very  good reason.   He considers\n himself to be  in a permanent state      of war with the United States.\n COLLINGS:   Strategic deception.     Lying,  in    uther words.\n Do you approve?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:       Strategic        deception  in   a  military\n COLLINGS:    Do you approve?\n SENATOR  COHEN:     I  think we  have  to draw  a distinction\n once    again.    It's  one  thing  to have  ships   steaming  toward      the\n coast  of  Libya.      That  is a fact  if we are doing it.   It's quite\n another to,               I think, publish reports, feed reports  to  American\n journalists   and  suggest      that  there  is  a coup  in      the    making  to\n ovrethrow Qaddafi,     that he  is  internally         unstable,  that we  are\n giving     aid  and comfort,    as  such,  to those       forces  who wish  to\n overthrow      him,    when in  fact   the   situation   might              be quite\n different.\n As  far     as  Qaddafi himself, it's perhaps a bad example.\n But nonetheless what     it does    is  it throws that seed  of      disbelief\n or  lack    of  credibility     out there so that we are never believed.\n If in fact we have...\n COLLINGS:    We have to take a break at  this point,  and we\n will be right back.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n COLLINGS:      On   Newsmaker   Saturday,   our   topic   is\n disinformation  and  credibility.\n Admiral   Turner,   in World War II the United States lied\n about  the location  of  the   invasion  at  Normandy  in order  to save\n lives   of American soldiers.   That was wartime.   We're not   at war\n now,  and yet we are still     lying.   Why  is that?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:      There     are  some times,  even   in\n peacetime,  when you do lie.   A     friend  of mine,  for instance,  was\n asked  by  a newspaperman  the      day  that the  Iranian rescue operation\n was  actually  taking  place,  \"Is  there  not  a      rescue   operation\n taking place?\"    And my friend,   very  appropriately, said,  \"No.\"\n He  called  the     newsman  the next   day and          said, \"I\n apologize.          I deliberately lied to you.   But there were lives at\n stake yesterday,  and so I could not even waffle my    answer to you.\n I  had  to be categoric in  saying no.\"\n COLLINGS:   So when lives are at       stake,  it's  all  right.\n Are  there any  other  conditions  when  it's all  right?\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   We  think  of ourselves as being at, peace\n and we think       of peace treaties and armistices and truces       and war\n and  declarations  of  war.        Some our  adversaries  in   this  day  and\n age  don't think that  way.    They  consider     themselves  to be  in     a\n permanent  state  of war  with  Western  democracies,  albeit  conducted\n through  indirect  means,   whether it's subversion  or  penetration       or\n disinformation or state-sponsored terrorism.\n COLLINGS: But that's what      they consider.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Yes.\n COLLINGS:   Why    should we   think  the  same way  they  do?\n Why  should we behave the same  way  they  do?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   If  people consider      themselves to be at\n war  against  the  citadel  of  capitalism  --  namely,  the  United\n States --  as  they  call  it,  well,    then, obviously we  have to\n react.       And you're not going to be conducting   this according to\n the Marquis   of Queensberry's  rules,   are you?\n COLLINGS:   Senator Cohen,  do you think we should use the\n same means  that  they do?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   Well,  I  think  one  of the difficulties\n with making  such    a  broad  statement is  that    if  you  adopt. the\n policies  that the Libyans  or  the Soviets  or  any  other  countries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n who  have  declared  war,   active  or  covert,   or  terroristic     or\n conventional, against  the United  States,  it    seems  to me  if that's\n the general proposition,     then you can always say  it's    open for us\n to deceive the  enemy.   And  the  question is,   how  does  one  go about\n deceiving the enemy?\n It seems to me that if  we adopt  that  as     a general\n policy,   that it's all right  to put  deceptive measures         into the\n media  to convey  that  to keep the enemy guessing,  then we have a\n question  of  when  do the  American   people     really  believe   that\n the  President or  the  White  House    or  the   Congress is     actually\n telling them the truth.     Right now...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:      That's   our     job,   Senator.     As\n journalists,  we  can't        be  spoon-fed.     When  we  say       in   our\n profession,   \"We've  been   lied     to,\"   that is     sanctimonious,\n hypocritical  nonsense.      What  government     has  not  lied?   What\n government  has not misled  or     tried  to mislead the press?\n So, what are we? Are  we  journalists,     or  are we  just\n conveyor belts for government    information?\n SENATOR COHEN:        That assumes that the government         is in  a\n state  of  constantly lying to the press.   I don't believe that      to\n be  the case.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No,  it  isn't.   But  we can see through\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:       And that's what was so foolish          in this\n case.  Because the day  after the Wall Street Journal printed that\n story, Leslie Gelb  of the New York      Times just decimated it      in his\n paper because it was a bad story.   And the Administration        should\n have   recognized that  planting  something  like  that  in the U.S.\n media  was  bound  to blow  up  in  their  face,  as  it  did.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    They did not plant it  in the U.S.  media.\n That has been determined. There was nothing planted  in the         U.S.\n media.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER: That      certainly  is      not  true.   That's\n just an assertion by...\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No.   No,  not  at  all.   You can check it\n out.   And in fact,  the Intelligence Committee has checked it      out.\n There  was  a  memo  floating  around,  a  memo  floating around --    I\n think  the  Senator  can  confirm      this. No  disinformation      was\n planted in the U.S.  media.\n ADMIRAL      TURNER:   Oh, that's certainly untrue.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   At that time?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   That's  certainly untrue.   Now,  it may\n not  have     been  authorized by the  President of  the  United  States,\n but  disinformation  was  planted by  somebody  in   the  Administration.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   Even the Wall   Street  Journal  will    tell\n you  that     they  were not victims  of disinformation.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,   they're  trying  to cover  their\n number,  too.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  No.       Because there were two things that\n were  correct  there, Admiral,  and   we  just    discussed  them  at  the\n top  of the program.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   You  have heard  they   are correct.   I\n don't   agree with     what  you said.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:  You're not part      of the Administration.\n Here's someone who's on the Intelligence Committee.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   He's  not part  of the Administration.\n He's  in the Congress.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   He's  done  his homework.   And Bernie Kalb\n resigned   on the  strength      of    Bob  Woodward's  piece   in    the\n Washington    Post, not   on     the   strength  of  anything  else    he\n discovered.\n COLLINGS:     All  right, but  he  did resign.    And   that\n implies  that  he    felt that the Administration had  lied  and had,  in\n fact,  gotten caught    lying.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE: He     took  Bob  Woodward's    piece at  face\n value.    And  even   Bob   Woodward  corrected           his piece three days\n later.\n SENATOR COHEN:   The nature  of the problem is,  as we're\n seeing now with            the alleged involvement in Nicaragua of the CIA,\n if  you  took  a poll  on the streets  of America,      I  suppose that the\n majority       would come  back  and  say, \"We don't  believe  the  denial.\"\n And  that  is  the  difficulty  that one  has  once   you  are  perceived to\n have been deceiving    or planting stories   or not  leveling with    the\n American       people. It      tends  to undermine everything, even when\n you're right.      That's sort  of    the road  you  walk  down. Once you\n take  a   lie  and   give    it  the  perfume  of  truth,  ultimately what\n happens    is  truth  has  the  perfume   of  lies.    And  no matter how\n truthful       your  statement  might  be,     it is perceived  to  be  a\n falsehood.     And that's  the  danger  we   run.\n So,  we've  got   to have  those c                t     hick we\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07: CIA-RD gf 8g 01  666900~8d(fi%-\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n in fact\n o\n t  i\n do\n engage in disinformation be very,  very clearly  spelled\n u\n n\n oli\n our\n own minds as to when it's justified.   But as a general\n p\n cy,\n we\n lose,  ultimately,  when  we  are        perceived  to  have\n engaged\n or\n pursue a policy  of engaging in disinformation.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:    But  haven't  all  Administrations  had\n credibility gaps,  Senator?\n SENATOR COHEN:     Oh,  of       course.     That's  a constant\n problem with the Congress,   as well: Do we have a credibility gap\n between  what we  say  and  what we  do?\n COLLINGS: How does     this  Administration  compare with\n others in terms     of credibility gap?\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:      I  am  yet to meet  a  public official,\n whether it's here  or abroad,    who doesn't speak with three voices:\n the      on-the-record voice,    beyond-the-record  voice,    and the\n background voice.  And sometimes they're 180 degrees apart.\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:  But  if  you  look   at  the  record, this\n Administration's credibility has been challenged much more often.\n I  look  on   it  from a rather  parochial  point     of view\n because I worry about      another wave of public lack  of confidence\n in  the  CIA.   And these  two  events,  the  shooting  down of the\n airplane in Nicaragua and the   disinformation  against   Libya are\n reviving that  again,  just  as  we  had  with  the     mining of the\n harbors  in Nicaragua and   the manual  of   assassination  and the\n assassination   effort     against  a man named Fadlallah in Beirut.\n All of these...\n COLLINGS:   Well, what do you think  is the extent  of CIA\n involvement in Nicaragua?\n ADMIRAL   TURNER:    Well,  I think  there's  very  little\n question that the CIA  is providing help and support  and advice to\n these people who are  freebooters and are doing things down there.\n They're doing it       on the verge of the law.   I don't think they're\n doing anything technically  illegal.\n COLLINGS:     But   when   they       deny  it, then   it's   a\n credibility  problem.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   They're perfectly proper in denying it.\n But  their credibility  is  bad  because  they're   working     on   the\n wording of the  law,  not  on the  spirit  and  the  intent  of  the  law.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Have  you       noticed,  Admiral,    how  when\n somebody goes   down  and fights against  the communists in a Third\n World country he becomes a vulgar mercenary,  and if someone is\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n fighting     on  the  communists's  side  he  is  treated  with awesome\n veneration?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   I  certainly don't  have any veneration\n for the Sandinistas.   I don't know what      you're talking about.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   No, but an American was killed  fighting\n with  the  Sandinistas   a     couple of  years  ago,   and  it  made        a\n paragraph    or  two in  the  papers  and  he was called  an  idealist.\n COLLINGS:   Well, we'll take a break  at  this      point,    and\n then we'll be  right back?\n COLLINGS:     We're   talking   about   truth,        lies   and,\n credibility....\n Admiral  Turner, how     much long-term      damage     is  being\n caused  to  the  CIA    and   to  the  Administration     by  the  kind     of\n credibility gap you've been talking about?\n ADMIRAL TURNER: I think  it's considerable because    it's\n happened     over  a considerable period of time.         We must remember,\n Tony,  that the  most  fundamental     strength  of       our country  is  a\n well-informed      electorate,    well-informed citizens. I think the\n citizens     have been  not  well  informed  in  these   cases  and      the\n citizens     are  going  to question  what  the government says  in the\n future.      And  that will  be  very injurious     to  our  democratic\n process.\n COLLINGS:   And yet   you yourself say that  disinformation\n COLLINGS:    How can you have it both ways?\n ADMIRAL TURNER:   Because you don't want  to disinform the\n American     public.     The instance I  cited  to  you, the   American\n public      never  knew  about   it, because  it  was a  very   limited\n disinformation program.   You    have  to take  some  risks        once  in  a\n while.      Disinforming  one  person  is  an extreme case.   Sometimes\n you disinform a larger group.   When you do it      overseas,     which you\n really  should --  you    never should do it  in the United States --\n you are risking  that  it  will                  come  back    into  the  United  States\n media  because we  really  have  one world    media.  So,        again,    you\n have to be very careful about     it.\n Much  of  the disinformation the United States  needs to\n put  out really   isn't disinformation. It's getting into other\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n countries true information by  surreptitious means,  often,     because\n it  won't get  in any  other way.\n COLLINGS:    We'll put that  aside  and  just         talk  about\n disinformation.\n Senator?\n SENATOR  COHEN:  Just  to  correct  a point.   Number one,\n the  CIA     was not  involved  in  a  disinformation    campaign,  for\n openers.   They  are  not  involved.\n Number two, I think that the CIA has enjoyed an increase\n in its stature in     the  past  four  or  five  years.  Certainly  the\n morale  is  much  higher  than  it  has    been in recent years.    And I\n think that  the  public   has taken a  different  attitude  toward  the\n CIA,  in     view  of  the kind  of circumstances we  find ourselves in\n globally.\n Number three, the   lack  of credibility,  I think, starts\n from the top-down.    A point  you made  in your opening  statement.\n It  seems    to me incomprehensible  as  to why  the    Administration\n would say    no deal has  been made with respect  to Mr.  Daniloff.   A\n deal  clearly was  made,  a  bargain    was  struck,  and they ought to\n say so.      Everybody else knows that.   And for the Administration,\n the President to say,        \"No trade,\" it  simply   starts taking the\n shine off the credibility.   And that     tends to filter down.\n But       as  far  as the CIA  is concerned, we have known for\n several years the Administration does want to maintain a vigorous\n campaign of support          for the Contras. The CIA will  in  fact play a\n role  in that  support.      Both  Houses of Congress have   voted  for\n such   a   measure.         It's waiting  for conference  action at this\n point.\n So,  I would say  it's somewhat misleading to suggest that\n the CIA now has a lack  of credibility.      It's  something  that  may\n affect     all of government, to the extent that we don't    level vith\n people on items  that  are   clearly          within  the  public domain and\n which common sense tells     them...\n COLLINGS:    Let  me  ask  you  this.   Your  committee  has\n oversight  responsibility    for  the   intelligence  community.    How\n much  attention  do you  devote to the question of disinformation,\n to make sure that there's no violation  of            the  guidelines on not\n misleading the American public?\n SENATOR  COHEN:   We  maintain a          very  vigorous oversight\n program.   I     think  that's why  we're  satisfied  the  CIA  was  not\n involved   in    any disinformation  campaign.    To  the  extent there\n were  individuals  within    the  White  House         or  within  the State\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release-2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901R000600400018-2\n Department    who  may   have  briefed  a          reporter  and  gave  him\n misinformation or disinformation,  that         should  not  be attributed\n to the        CIA.   This  was specifically n  of  a CIA program.   The CIA\n is looked at  very closely by us.\n COLLINGS:    Admiral,  you were about to make a point.\n ADMIRAL TURNER:      Well,  I was  going  to say  that it  is\n illegal,  I  believe,  Senator,  today        for  the  CIA  to support the\n Contras.\n SENATOR COHEN:    That's correct.\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Other than with  intelligence  support.\n SENATOR COHEN:     Other than with communications...\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Communications and intelligence.   So if\n they had any  role in the airplane incident,  it was  an illegality.\n It may not be illegal tomorrow,  if the Congress  passes  this  new\n law,  but it has been illegal up till now,        was illegal  if they did\n something yesterday.\n I  think  the  genesis  of  the whole Wall Street  [Journal]\n disinformation problem was a misinterpretation  by  the  CIA  of an\n intelligence         report  that     said Qaddafi was on the verge of being\n able to be toppled.    I       think  they  fell  for that one when   they\n shouldn't have because they wanted to believe that.\n SENATOR COHEN:   Can I  kind of just   contradict that for a\n moment?       The       CIA  was never misled  by  any report  that  said Qaddafi\n was  on the verge of being toppled.         From all the information that\n I  saw,  that clearly  was  not    the  case.   That information, wherever\n it came,  did not      come  from intelligence sources.\n COLLINGS: Let me ask you about...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   The Admiral made a point  about       credibi-\n lity  and                       said  that it's     very important  that  we  not  question our\n government,  that     we believe   our government.   I hope  that  in  this\n profession,        Admiral,  we  never  stop      questioning our government.\n That's   part            of the democratic process.   Always  question your\n government.   That's what makes  it  a healthy society.\n COLLINGS:        But   the  government   has     to   take into\n consideratin  the  fact  that  it's being questioned by       the press.\n But  it has certain objectives,            which  include  goals that  can be\n achieved by   lying,     in effect.\n DE  BORCHGRAVE:   Every     Administration,  Tony,       tries\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n\f Approved For Release 2006/02/07 : CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2\n every Administration,  Tony,  tries to manage the news...\n DE BORCHGRAVE:   ...and  put  the  best  face  possible  on\n what  they're  doing.   And  our  job  in  the media is to try to see\n through    it.\n COLLINGS: Let me  ask  you about the Soviets.   How much\n mileage do you  think they will get   out  of the problems that    have\n cropped up  recently with Administration credibility,  on Libya,     on\n Nicaragua, on other matters?\n SENATOR   COHEN:   Well, in a recent item that  appeared in\n the      newspaper,   the   Soviet Union       jumped   upon Secretary\n Weinberger's  statement     that  the Soviets,  to the extent that they\n pulled any troops     out  of Afghanistan,  will only replace them with\n fresh  troops. The Soviet paper clearly jumped on that      and said,\n \"We are surprised and shocked that a high       official  would  engage\n in such,    quote,  a falsehood.\"\n COLLINGS:   We have only  a few seconds  left.\n Admiral   Turner,    what's   your   view   on   the Soviet\n exploitation of this credibility problem?\n ADMIRAL  TURNER:   Well,  I think they  will  do everything\n they  can  to  exploit  it.   I'm not  sure  it  will get   them a lot of\n mileage,    truly.\n DE BORCHGRAVE:    Our   problem  is  that   we're choirboys\n trying to deal with Jack the Ripper.\n COLLINGS: Okay.   That's  all we have time    for.\n Approved For Release 2006/02/07.: CIA-RDP91-00901 R000600400018-2"
