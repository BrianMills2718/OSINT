- "How do federal cybersecurity contracts connect to cleared job opportunities?"
- "What are the connections between special operations units and intelligence agencies?"

**Entity-Focused Research**:
- "Map the relationships between defense contractors working on AI security"
- "What organizations are involved in signals intelligence collection?"

**Investigative Questions**:
- "Trace the evolution of drone warfare programs across military and intelligence agencies"
- "What are the oversight mechanisms for covert operations?"

## Comparison: AI Research vs Deep Research

### 🤖 AI Research (Quick)
- **Speed**: 10-30 seconds
- **Approach**: Searches selected databases in parallel
- **Output**: Results from each database + AI summary
- **Best for**: Fast lookups, known topics, specific queries
- **Example**: "What cybersecurity jobs are available?"

### 🔬 Deep Research (Thorough)
- **Speed**: Minutes to hours (configurable)
- **Approach**: Multi-phase investigation with task decomposition
- **Features**:
  - Breaks complex questions into sub-tasks
  - Retries failed searches with reformulated queries
  - Tracks entity relationships across results
  - Creates follow-up tasks based on findings
- **Output**: Comprehensive research report with entity network
- **Best for**: Complex multi-part questions, investigations
- **Example**: "What is the relationship between JSOC and CIA Title 50 operations?"

## Technical Details

### Progress Callback System

The UI uses a progress callback to receive real-time updates:

```python
def progress_callback(progress: ResearchProgress):
    """Handle progress updates from deep research engine."""
    # Update UI with event data
    # Track statistics
    # Display live progress
```

**Events Tracked**:
- `research_started` - Investigation begins
- `decomposition_started/complete` - Question broken into tasks
- `task_created` - New task created
- `task_started` - Task execution begins
- `task_completed` - Task succeeded
- `task_failed` - Task failed after retries
- `task_retry` - Retrying with reformulated query
- `entity_discovered` - New entity found
- `relationship_discovered` - Entity relationship found
- `follow_ups_created` - Follow-up tasks generated
- `synthesis_started/complete` - Final report generation

### Data Export Format

**Markdown Export** (`report.md`):
- Research question
- Timestamp
- Full report (markdown formatted)
- Statistics
- Entities discovered
- Sources searched

**JSON Export** (`research_data.json`):
```json
{
  "research_question": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T...",
  "configuration": {
    "max_tasks": 10,
    "max_time_minutes": 60,
    ...
  },
  "results": {
    "report": "...",
    "tasks_executed": 5,
    "entity_relationships": {...},
    ...
  },
  "progress_log": [
    {
      "timestamp": "...",
      "event": "task_created",
      "message": "...",
      "task_id": 0
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Data Source Coverage

The current 7-8 database integrations (SAM.gov, DVIDS, USAJobs, ClearanceJobs, FBI Vault, Federal Register, Brave Search) are public databases.

**They contain**:
- Government contracts
- Job postings
- Declassified FBI documents
- Federal Register notices
- Military media
- Web search results (Brave)

**They do NOT contain**:
- Classified operational documents
- Intelligence community internal reports
- Most military/intelligence operational details

**Result**: Questions about JSOC/CIA operations may find limited direct results but will generate insightful reports based on LLM knowledge.

### 2. Brave Search Integration

Brave Search integration is being added by another LLM. Once complete, deep research will be able to:
- Pull web results for complex questions
- Find academic papers, news articles, think tank reports
- Significantly improve results for intelligence/military questions

### 3. Current Bug Fixed

**Bug**: `'AdaptiveSearchResult' object has no attribute 'get'`
**Status**: Fixed in `research/deep_research.py` line 387-393
**Impact**: Retry logic now works correctly

---

## Performance Expectations

### Small Questions (3-5 tasks)
- **Time**: 2-5 minutes
- **Tasks**: 3-5 initial + 0-2 follow-ups
- **Results**: 10-50 total results
- **Entities**: 5-15 discovered

### Medium Questions (5-10 tasks)
- **Time**: 5-15 minutes
- **Tasks**: 5-10 initial + 2-5 follow-ups
- **Results**: 50-150 total results
- **Entities**: 15-30 discovered

### Large Questions (10+ tasks)
- **Time**: 15-60 minutes
- **Tasks**: 10-15 initial + 5-10 follow-ups
- **Results**: 100-500 total results
- **Entities**: 30-50+ discovered

**Note**: These are estimates. Actual performance depends on:
- Database response times
- Number of retries needed
- Entity discovery rate
- Follow-up task creation

- **State Persistence**: Save/resume long investigations
- **Advanced Entity Extraction**: Use NLP to extract specific entity types
- **Graph Visualization**: Visual entity relationship graphs (networkx/graphviz)
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare entities across different time periods
- **Alert Integration**: Create monitors for discovered entities

### Long-Term (Phase 2-4)
- Knowledge graph integration (PostgreSQL, Weeks 5-8)
- Advanced memory systems (A-MEM)
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Human-in-the-loop approval gates

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No module named 'streamlit'"
**Solution**: Activate virtual environment first
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run apps/unified_search_app.py
```

### Error: "OpenAI API Key Required"
**Solution**: Add API key to `.env` file
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
```

### Error: All tasks failing with 0 results
**Expected**: Public databases may not have data for specialized questions
**Solution**:
- Try simpler questions that databases can answer
- Wait for Brave Search integration
- LLM will still generate insightful reports based on training data

### UI freezes during research
**Expected**: Streamlit runs synchronously, UI updates after research completes
**Note**: Progress events are collected and displayed after execution
**Future Enhancement**: Could use `st.status()` context manager for better UX
