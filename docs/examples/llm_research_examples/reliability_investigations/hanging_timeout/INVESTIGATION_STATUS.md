# API Hang/Timeout Investigation Status

**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: In Progress - Root Cause Unknown  
**Priority**: Critical - Blocks zero-intervention capability

## üéØ PROBLEM STATEMENT

System generation via CLI hangs consistently during LLM calls, despite individual LLM components working correctly. This is a recurring issue that has persisted throughout project development.

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED FACTS (100% Certain)

### Working Components
- **Individual LLM calls**: Work consistently (5-6 seconds)
- **LLMComponentGenerator**: Works in isolation (31 seconds for single component)
- **Basic infrastructure**: Threading patterns, event loops, basic async work fine
- **Blueprint generation**: Works quickly (3 seconds)
- **SystemGenerator initialization**: Works correctly
- **Port auto-generation**: Functions properly

### Failing Components
- **CLI system generation**: Hangs consistently after 60+ seconds
- **System-level LLM calls**: First LLM call in system context hangs indefinitely

## üîç SYSTEMATIC TEST EVIDENCE

### Test 1: Basic LLM Provider
```
‚úÖ PASS Basic LLM Provider: 5.86s - Response: test response
```

### Test 2: ThreadPoolExecutor Pattern
```
‚úÖ PASS ThreadPoolExecutor Pattern: 6.55s - Response: threadpool test
```

### Test 3: Individual Component Generation
```
‚úÖ PASS LLMComponentGenerator: 31.10s - Generated 8485 chars
```

### Test 4: Full System Generation
```
‚è∞ HUNG Full System Generation: Timed out after 64.64s
```

## üìç PRECISE HANG LOCATION

**File**: `healing_integration.py`  
**Function**: `generate_system_from_yaml()`  
**Specific point**: First LLM call during component generation loop  
**Call stack**: 
```
CLI ‚Üí generate_system_from_description_async() 
    ‚Üí SystemGenerator.generate_system_from_yaml()
    ‚Üí HealingIntegratedGenerator.generate_system_with_healing()
    ‚Üí Component generation loop
    ‚Üí HANGS on first LLM call
```

## üö´ WHAT WE DON'T KNOW (Requires Investigation)

1. **Root Cause**: Why LLM calls work individually but hang in system context
2. **Async Context Differences**: What's different between working and hanging contexts
3. **Resource Contention**: Whether it's deadlock, connection pool, or other resource issue
4. **LLM Provider Specifics**: Whether it's provider-specific or general async issue
5. **Event Loop Issues**: Whether nested event loops or async context problems

## üìä INVESTIGATION LOGS

### Hang Isolation Test Results
```
‚úÖ Step 1: Environment loaded
‚úÖ Step 2: NL Translator initialized  
‚úÖ Step 3: Blueprint generation completed (3030 chars)
‚úÖ Step 4: SystemGenerator initialized
‚ùå Step 5: HANGS during first LLM call in system generation
```

### LLM Call Progression
```
üîç TEMPLATE DEBUG: Context variables for Source: ‚úÖ
üîç PROMPT ENGINE: build_component_prompt called: ‚úÖ
üîç ACTUAL PROMPT SAVED: ‚úÖ
LLM call attempt 1/6: ‚ùå HANGS
```

## üî¨ COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Context | LLM Call Result | Duration | Success |
|---------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Individual (isolated) | ‚úÖ Complete | 5-6s | 100% |
| Component Generator | ‚úÖ Complete | 31s | 100% |
| System Generation | ‚ùå Hangs | 60+s | 0% |

**Key Insight**: Same LLM infrastructure works in some contexts but not others.

## üéØ INVESTIGATION HYPOTHESES TO TEST

### Hypothesis 1: Async Context Deadlock
- **Theory**: System generation creates nested async context that deadlocks
- **Test**: Compare async call stacks between working/hanging contexts
- **Evidence needed**: Async context state during hang

### Hypothesis 2: Resource Pool Exhaustion  
- **Theory**: System generation exhausts connection pools or shared resources
- **Test**: Monitor connection counts, resource usage during hang
- **Evidence needed**: Resource utilization metrics

### Hypothesis 3: Event Loop Conflicts
- **Theory**: Multiple event loops or improper async handling
- **Test**: Check for nested event loops, improper asyncio.run usage
- **Evidence needed**: Event loop state analysis

### Hypothesis 4: LLM Provider Configuration
- **Theory**: System context changes LLM provider configuration causing hang
- **Test**: Compare LLM provider state in working vs hanging contexts
- **Evidence needed**: Provider configuration differences

### Hypothesis 5: Sequential Generation Bottleneck
- **Theory**: Sequential component generation creates bottleneck/deadlock
- **Test**: Test parallel vs sequential generation patterns
- **Evidence needed**: Generation pattern analysis

## üö® BUSINESS IMPACT

- **Zero-intervention capability**: BLOCKED
- **System generation**: BROKEN for multi-component systems  
- **Development velocity**: REDUCED due to unreliable generation
- **User experience**: POOR due to hanging/timeouts

## üìã NEXT STEPS

**IMPORTANT**: This issue has been "a continually recurring issue throughout the development of this project and other projects" - suggesting it may be a fundamental architectural or infrastructure problem rather than a simple bug.
