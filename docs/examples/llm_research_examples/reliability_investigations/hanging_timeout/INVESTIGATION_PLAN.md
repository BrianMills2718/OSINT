- **What**: Check if module loading or import state causes issues
- **How**: Monitor module loading patterns during generation
- **Evidence**: Module import timing, circular imports, state conflicts
- **Success criteria**: Identify module-related hang causes

#### Test 4.3: Configuration Propagation Analysis
- **What**: Track how configuration propagates through system generation
- **How**: Add detailed configuration logging throughout call chain
- **Evidence**: Configuration state changes affecting LLM calls
- **Success criteria**: Identify configuration-related hang causes

### Phase 5: Isolation & Reproduction (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Create minimal reproduction case and validate fix

#### Test 5.1: Minimal Reproduction Case
- **What**: Create smallest possible test case that reproduces hang
- **How**: Strip down system generation to essential components only
- **Evidence**: Minimal code that consistently reproduces issue
- **Success criteria**: Reproducible test case under 50 lines

#### Test 5.2: Fix Validation
- **What**: Implement and validate fix based on root cause findings
- **How**: Apply targeted fix and verify system generation works
- **Evidence**: Consistent system generation success
- **Success criteria**: 100% success rate on system generation
