        This platform helps you research information across multiple government and job databases **simultaneously**.

        **Key Features:**

        1. **‚ö° Quick Search** - Ask questions in plain English, get answers from multiple databases at once
        2. **üî¨ Deep Investigation** - Complex multi-part research with autonomous task decomposition
        3. **üìä Monitor Management** - Set up alerts that email you when new information appears

        **What Makes This Different:**
        - Instead of searching multiple websites separately, ask ONE question and get ALL results
        - AI understands your question and automatically creates the right searches
        - Get daily email alerts for ongoing investigations

        **What It Does:**
        - You ask a question in plain English
        - AI automatically searches multiple databases for you
        - You get a summary + detailed results in 10-20 seconds

        **Good Questions to Ask:**
        - "What intelligence analyst jobs require TS/SCI clearance?"
        - "Find contracts related to cyber threat detection in the last 2 months"
        - "What are the latest developments in AI security across government jobs and contracts?"
        - "Show me special operations content from DVIDS in the Middle East"

        **Bad Questions (Too Vague):**
        - "Jobs" (be specific: what kind of jobs?)
        - "Security stuff" (what aspect of security?)

        **How It Works:**
        1. Go to the **‚ö° Quick Search** tab
        2. Type your question in the text box
        3. Click **üöÄ Research**
        4. Wait 10-20 seconds while AI searches databases in parallel
        5. Review summary and detailed results
        6. Download CSV exports if needed

        **Pro Tips:**
        - ‚úÖ Be specific about what you're looking for
        - ‚úÖ Mention timeframes if relevant ("last 2 months", "recent")
        - ‚úÖ Include key requirements (clearance level, location, skills)
        - ‚ùå Don't use yes/no questions
        - ‚ùå Don't ask for analysis the databases can't provide

        **What It Does:**
        - Autonomous multi-step research for complex questions
        - Breaks questions into subtasks automatically
        - Iterates and refines searches based on findings
        - Tracks entity relationships across results
        - Takes 5-30 minutes depending on complexity

        **When to Use:**
        - Complex, multi-part questions that need thorough investigation
        - When you want to explore connections between entities
        - Research that benefits from iterative refinement
        - When Quick Search isn't thorough enough

        **Examples:**
        - "What is the relationship between JSOC and CIA Title 50 operations?"
        - "How do government surveillance programs use AI, and who are their contractors?"
        - "Analyze the network of defense contractors working on cyber threat detection"

        **How It Works:**
        1. Go to the **üî¨ Deep Investigation** tab
        2. Enter your complex research question
        3. Adjust settings (max tasks, time limit, concurrency)
        4. Click **Start Investigation**
        5. Watch real-time progress as tasks execute in parallel
        6. Review comprehensive report with entity network

        **Settings Explained:**
        - **Max Tasks:** How many subtasks to execute (default: 15)
        - **Max Retries:** How many times to retry failed queries (default: 2)
        - **Time Limit:** Maximum investigation duration (default: 120 minutes)
        - **Min Results:** Minimum results per task to succeed (default: 3)

        **What You Get:**
        - Executive summary of findings
        - Detailed analysis with connections between entities
        - Entity relationship network
        - Source attribution
