        - Try "last 60 days" or no date filter

        **3. Try a different database**
        - Some topics only appear in certain sources
        - ClearanceJobs: Jobs only
        - SAM.gov: Contracts only
        - DVIDS: Military media only
        - USAJobs: Federal jobs only

        **4. Check if database is actually relevant**
        - Looking for contracts? Won't find them in ClearanceJobs
        - Looking for jobs? Won't find them in DVIDS

        **5. Use AI Research instead**
        - AI understands which databases to search
        - Better at handling vague queries

        **Common errors and fixes:**

        **"429 Rate Limit Exceeded" (SAM.gov)**
        - Wait 5-10 minutes
        - Avoid rapid repeated searches
        - Use monitors for ongoing tracking

        **"Connection timeout"**
        - Database server might be slow or down
        - Wait 30 seconds and retry
        - Try a different database

        **"No module named..."**
        - Technical error - report to admin
        - Usually fixed by restarting the app

        **"Failed to generate queries"**
        - OpenAI API issue
        - Check your API key
        - Check OpenAI status: https://status.openai.com

        **"JSON parse error"**
        - Temporary AI hiccup
        - Just retry the search
        - If persistent, try rewording your question

        **"Why is this so slow?"**

        **Expected speeds:**
        - AI Research: **15-30 seconds** (searching 4 databases + AI analysis)
        - Advanced Search: **2-10 seconds** per database
        - Monitor creation: **Instant**
        - Monitor execution: **20-60 seconds**

        **What affects speed:**
        - Number of databases searched
        - SAM.gov is slowest (often 5-10 seconds)
        - AI analysis takes time
        - Network conditions

        **How to speed things up:**
        - Use Advanced Search for single databases (faster)
        - Reduce "Results per database" setting
        - Search fewer databases in AI Research

        **When to worry:**
        - Search takes >2 minutes ‚Üí Something's wrong, refresh page
        - Page is frozen ‚Üí Refresh browser
        - Consistent errors ‚Üí Report to admin

        **Not worried:**
        - 15-30 seconds for AI Research ‚Üí Normal
        - 5-10 seconds for SAM.gov ‚Üí Normal (they're slow)
