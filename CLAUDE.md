## Codex-Generated Structural Issues

### Issue #110: Tier 4 Harness Config Gap (Codex Generated)
**Priority**: Critical
**Impact**: False negatives in test execution, tests don't measure real deployment conditions

**Problem**: Tier 4's inferred runner doesn't use the actual blueprint or harness. Tests run in a simulated environment that doesn't match deployment, leading to false passing/failing tests.

**Solution**: Replace Tier 4's inferred runner with contract-driven fixtures:
- Load the blueprint
- Build the real harness
- Hydrate required config/resources
- Execute components via the harness so behavior is measured under the same conditions we deploy

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refactor Tier 4 harness to use blueprint + fixtures
- [ ] Implement config/resource hydration from blueprint
- [ ] Execute components through real harness instead of inferred runner
- [ ] Rerun failing systems to confirm fix eliminates false negatives

### Issue #111: Missing Contract-Driven Test Specs (Codex Generated)
**Priority**: High
**Impact**: LLM has to imagine test cases from scratch, inconsistent test quality

**Problem**: No per-recipe test specifications exist. The system asks the LLM to generate test cases without guidance, leading to inconsistent and incomplete testing.

**Solution**: Define per-recipe test specifications (inputs, expected invariants, fixture builders). Let Tier 4 pick the right spec instead of asking the LLM to imagine test cases from scratch.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define contract specs for Source recipes (fixtures + invariants)
- [ ] Define contract specs for Transformer recipes
- [ ] Define contract specs for Sink recipes
- [ ] Create fixture builder framework
- [ ] Update Tier 4 to select appropriate spec per recipe type

### Issue #112: Bundler Syntax Corruption (Codex Generated)
**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Generated scripts have syntax errors, deployment failures

**Problem**: The Tier 4 bundler uses text-splicing to combine components, which corrupts syntax and breaks generated scripts.

**Solution**: Build regression harness and patch bundler to import components instead of text-splicing them.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Build regression harness that round-trips generated scripts through ast.parse
- [ ] Identify all text-splicing locations in bundler
- [ ] Refactor bundler to import components instead of splicing
- [ ] Run regression suite to verify no syntax corruption
- [ ] Add continuous validation to prevent future regressions

### Issue #113: Prompt-Driven Maintenance Spiral (Codex Generated)
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Increasing prompt complexity, harder to maintain, unclear what rules are still needed

**Problem**: Prompt tweaks accumulate over time to patch structural issues. Once structural fixes are in place, many prompt rules may be redundant but we don't know which ones.

**Solution**: Treat prompt tweaks as last-mile polish—once the test harness enforces real contracts, re-run the evidence suite and keep only the prompt rules still needed.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Document all current prompt rules and their purpose
- [ ] Wait for Issues #110-#112 to be resolved (structural fixes)
- [ ] Rerun full evidence suite with structural fixes
- [ ] Identify which prompt rules are still needed
- [ ] Remove redundant prompt rules
- [ ] Recalculate zero-intervention metric to measure improvement

## Notes

**Reorganization Complete**: All files moved to new structure, imports updated, documentation refreshed.

**Testing Strategy**: Core components tested without API calls. Live testing requires:
- OpenAI API key (for LLM calls)
- SAM.gov API key
- DVIDS API key
- USAJobs API key
- Puppeteer MCP server (for ClearanceJobs)

**Discord Integration**: Deferred until current integrations are stable. Will be added as separate phase.
