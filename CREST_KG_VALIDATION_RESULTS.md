# crest_kg Validation Results

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: FAIL - Time overhead too high
**Decision**: NO-GO (with optimization recommendations for future)

---

## Test Environment
- Model: gpt-5-mini (via llm_utils.py)
- Sample size: 5 results (realistic Deep Investigation data)
- Test runs: Multiple (consistent results)

---

## Step 1: Schema Compatibility ✅ PASS

**Test**: `tests/test_crest_kg_schema_validation.py`

**Result**: Schema works perfectly with gpt-5-mini strict JSON mode

**Evidence**:
```json
{
  "entities": 6,
  "relationships": 5,
  "entities_with_attributes": 6/6,
  "relationships_with_attributes": 4/5
}
```

**Sample entity**:
```json
{
  "id": "jsoc",
  "name": "Joint Special Operations Command",
  "type": "organization",
  "attributes": {
    "headquarters": "fort_bragg",
    "operates_under_authority": "title_50"
  }
}
```

**Verdict**: ✅ PASS - Wikibase-compatible schema works with gpt-5-mini

---

## Step 2: Quality Comparison ❌ FAIL (Time)

**Test**: `tests/test_crest_kg_quality_comparison.py`

### Entity Coverage ✅ PASS

| Metric | Simple | Enhanced | Winner |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Entity count | 8-9 | 16-20 | Enhanced (+77%) |
| Relationships | 0 | 20-24 | Enhanced |
| Attributes | None | 12-20 | Enhanced |

**Missing in enhanced**: 4-6 entities (naming variations)
- Examples: "Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)" vs "JSOC" + "Joint Special Operations Command"
- Not a quality issue - just different entity normalization

**Additional in enhanced**: 12-17 entities
- Examples: "Signals Intelligence", "SEAL Team Six", "Presidential Findings"
- These are mentioned in context but not extracted by simple prompt

**Verdict**: ✅ PASS - Enhanced extracts more entities without losing core ones

---

### Relationship Quality ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW

**Sample relationships extracted**:
```json
{
  "source": "jsoc",
  "target": "cia",
  "type": "works_with",
  "attributes": {
    "context": "counterterrorism operations",
    "authority": "title_50"
  }
}
```

**Observations**:
- 20-24 relationships extracted per 5 results
- Types: works_with, conducts_operations_in, provides_support, headquartered_at, requires, grants_authority
- Attributes provide useful context

**Manual review** (spot check):
- ✅ "JSOC works_with CIA" - ACCURATE (stated in text)
- ✅ "JSOC conducts_operations_in Afghanistan" - ACCURATE (stated in text)
- ✅ "CIA provides_intelligence_support to JSOC" - ACCURATE (stated in text)
- ⚠️ "Title_50 requires Presidential_Findings" - ACCURATE but inferred from general knowledge
- ✅ "JSOC headquartered_at Fort_Liberty" - ACCURATE (stated in text)

**Accuracy estimate**: ~90% accurate, 10% inferred (acceptable for investigative tool)

**Verdict**: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS - Relationships mostly accurate, some inferred

---

### Performance ❌ FAIL

| Metric | Simple | Enhanced | Multiplier | Limit | Pass? |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|-------|
| Time | 12-14s | 55-66s | **3.9-4.7x** | 3.0x | ❌ **FAIL** |
| Cost | $0.0000 | $0.0000 | N/A | 5.0x | ✅ (unable to measure) |

**Time breakdown**:
- Simple: ~14s for 5 results = 2.8s per result
- Enhanced: ~60s for 5 results = 12s per result

**Projected impact on 9-task investigation**:
- Current: 9 tasks × 14s = **126 seconds** (2 min)
- Enhanced: 9 tasks × 60s = **540 seconds** (9 min overhead)

**For end-of-investigation extraction** (Option B from plan):
- Run once on ALL results (100+ results)
- Estimated: ~120-180 seconds (2-3 min)
- More acceptable than per-task overhead

**Verdict**: ❌ FAIL - Per-task overhead exceeds 3x limit

---

## Root Cause Analysis: Why So Slow?

### Prompt Complexity

**Simple prompt** (~200 tokens):
```
Extract key entities (people, organizations, programs) from search results.
Return JSON list of entity names (3-10 entities).
```

**Enhanced prompt** (~500 tokens):
```
Analyze search results and create knowledge graph in JSON format.
Extract entities (people, organizations, locations, events, concepts) and relationships.

For each entity:
- Create unique ID
- Identify type
- Record attributes

For each relationship:
- Identify source/target
- Describe relationship type
- Add attributes
```

**Impact**: 2.5x more prompt tokens → gpt-5-mini needs more reasoning

### Output Complexity

**Simple output** (~50 tokens):
```json
{"entities": ["JSOC", "CIA", "Afghanistan", "Title 50", ...]}
```

**Enhanced output** (~500 tokens):
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {"id": "jsoc", "name": "...", "type": "...", "attributes": {...}},
    ...
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "...", "target": "...", "type": "...", "attributes": {...}},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Impact**: 10x more output tokens → gpt-5-mini reasoning generates more structure

### gpt-5 Reasoning Tokens

**Key insight**: gpt-5 models use reasoning tokens BEFORE output tokens
- Simple task: ~10-20 reasoning tokens
- Complex structured task: ~100-200 reasoning tokens
- **More complex output → exponentially more reasoning time**

---

## Optimization Options (Not Tested)

### Option 1: Simpler Prompt
- Remove detailed instructions
- Use few-shot examples instead
- **Estimated impact**: 20-30% faster (still >3x)

### Option 2: gpt-4o-mini Instead
- Faster model without reasoning overhead
- **Estimated impact**: 50-60% faster (may pass 3x limit)
- **Tradeoff**: May lose some accuracy

### Option 3: End-of-Investigation Only
- Run once on ALL results (not per-task)
- **Estimated impact**: 2-3 min total vs 9 min overhead
- **Tradeoff**: Can't influence follow-up tasks

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
- Use simple extraction per-task (fast, for follow-ups)
- Use enhanced extraction at end (slow, for final report)
- **Estimated impact**: Best of both worlds
- **Complexity**: Need both code paths

---

## Manual Quality Review

**Question**: Are relationships + attributes worth 4x time cost?

**For investigative journalism**:
- ✅ Relationships help understand connections (JSOC ↔ CIA)
- ✅ Attributes provide context (operates under Title 50)
- ✅ Graph visualization could be useful for complex investigations
- ❌ But 9-minute overhead per investigation is too slow for daily use

**For optional feature**:
- If user enables it, 2-3 min at end of investigation
- **Acceptable** for deep dives (not daily monitoring)

---

## Final Verdict

### Overall: ❌ NO-GO (for current implementation)

**Reasons**:
1. ❌ Time overhead: **3.9-4.7x** exceeds 3.0x limit
2. ❌ Per-task overhead: 9 minutes total too slow
3. ✅ Schema works: No technical blockers
4. ✅ Quality good: Entities + relationships mostly accurate

### Recommendation: **DEFER with conditions**

**Defer because**:
- Current performance unacceptable for per-task extraction
- Optimization not tested yet (could bring it under 3x)

**Reconsider if**:
1. **End-of-investigation only** (2-3 min total acceptable)
2. **Use gpt-4o-mini** (faster, may pass 3x limit)
3. **User explicitly requests** (optional feature, they accept delay)

**Don't reconsider if**:
- Need per-task extraction for follow-up tasks
- Need real-time response (<30s total)
- Cost becomes prohibitive

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Document and Move On
- ✅ Document findings (this file)
- ✅ Update CREST_KG_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md with NO-GO decision
- ✅ Keep test scripts for future reference
- ❌ Do NOT implement full integration now

### Future (if priorities change):
1. Test gpt-4o-mini performance (30 min)
2. Implement end-of-investigation extraction only (2 hours)
3. Add as optional feature with clear performance warning (1 hour)

### Alternative: Keep Simple Extraction
- Current system works well
- Fast (2.8s per result)
- Good enough entity coverage (8-9 entities)
- Can always improve prompts without full KG

---

## Lessons Learned

### Validation Worked
- ✅ Caught performance issue BEFORE building full feature
- ✅ Saved 4-6 hours of implementation time
- ✅ Have data to make informed decision

### gpt-5 Reasoning Costs
- Complex structured output → exponential reasoning time
- Simple prompts → linear scaling
- **Design principle**: Keep prompts simple for gpt-5 models

### Optional Features Need Clear Value
- 4x slower must provide 4x more value
- Relationships are nice-to-have, not must-have
- **Product decision**: Is visualization worth the wait?

## Cost Analysis (Estimated)

**Note**: litellm cost tracking returned $0, so estimates based on OpenAI pricing:

**gpt-5-mini pricing** (as of 2025-10):
- Input: $0.00015 / 1K tokens
- Output: $0.00015 / 1K tokens (reasoning + output combined)

**Per extraction**:
- Simple: ~250 input + 50 output = ~$0.00005
- Enhanced: ~600 input + 500 output = ~$0.00017

**Per 9-task investigation**:
- Simple: 9 × $0.00005 = **$0.00045**
- Enhanced: 9 × $0.00017 = **$0.00153** (3.4x more expensive)

**Acceptable?**: YES - Cost difference negligible ($0.001 vs time difference of 9 minutes)
