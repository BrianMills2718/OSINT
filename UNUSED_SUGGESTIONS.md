# Unused Suggestions from Your Feedback

## What I Did NOT Include (And Why)

### 1. MCP Python SDK Recommendation
**Your Input**: "Use https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk instead of implementing MCP on its own"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**Reason**: This project doesn't use MCP (Model Context Protocol). It's a multi-database search system, not an MCP server. This suggestion was from a different project example you showed me.
**Action Needed**: None for this project

---

### 2. Repomix + Gemini for Documentation
**Your Input**: "Use repomix.com to compact original repo, feed to Gemini to build docs"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED  
**Reason**: We already have comprehensive documentation (INVESTIGATIVE_PLATFORM_VISION.md). This suggestion seems intended for starting a new codebase from an existing one.
**Action Needed**: None - docs already complete

---

### 3. Docker Auto-Refresh/Reload
**Your Input**: "In manage docker file, mount local files so don't rebuild after every change, make everything autorefresh/reload"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**Reason**: This project doesn't use Docker. It runs directly in Python virtual environment (.venv/).
**Action Needed**: If Docker becomes needed in future, add this pattern

---

### 4. Docker Versioning to Save Git Space
**Your Input**: "Version it correctly so don't eat up git space, keep cache but don't keep full docker image for every edit"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**Reason**: No Docker in this project
**Action Needed**: N/A

---

### 5. 7-Step Lifecycle Process
**Your Input**: "Project setup → Tool development → Data collection → Analysis → Documentation → Evidence transfer → Archive"

**Status**: PARTIALLY INCLUDED
**What I Included**: Archive strategy (dated folders, README explaining what/why)
**What I Didn't Include**: Formal 7-step process, /evidence/current/ structure
**Reason**: This seems specific to a different workflow. Our workflow is more: Design → Implement → Test → Archive
**Action Needed**: If you want this formal process, let me know and I'll add it

---

### 6. Success Declaration Framework
**Your Input**: 
```
SUCCESS CLAIM TEMPLATE (Mandatory Format)
**Verified Component**: [Specific component name]
**Evidence Commands**: [Exact commands run]
**Success Criteria Met**: [Specific criteria from above]
**Still Unverified**: [Explicit list of what's NOT verified]
**Confidence Level**: [1-10 with justification]
**Adversarial Challenge**: [What could still be broken?]
```

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED AS FORMAL TEMPLATE
**What I Included Instead**: 
- Evidence hierarchy (command output requirements)
- "What This DOES NOT Test" sections in each action
- Mandatory scope declaration
**Reason**: Template adds structure but core principles (evidence hierarchy, adversarial testing) achieve same goal more concisely
**Action Needed**: If you want this exact template format, I can add it

---

### 7. Forced Failure Reporting
**Your Input**: "You MUST find and report at least 3 things that: don't work, need verification, are unverified, could be broken"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED AS HARD REQUIREMENT
**What I Included Instead**: 
- Adversarial testing mentality
- "What This DOES NOT Test" sections
- Checkpoint questions ("What haven't I tested yet?")
**Reason**: Forcing "find 3 failures" could lead to false failures. Adversarial mentality achieves goal without arbitrary quota.
**Action Needed**: If you want hard quota (must find N failures), I can add it

---

### 8. Time-Boxing with Forced Reflection
**Your Input**: "Work in 25-minute focused blocks, at each break update 'What I Don't Know' list"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**What I Included Instead**: 15-minute checkpoints with 4 questions
**Reason**: 15-min checkpoints vs 25-min timeboxing - similar concept, slightly different timing
**Action Needed**: If you prefer 25-min Pomodoro-style blocks, I can adjust

---

### 9. Cognitive Bias Checks
**Your Input**: "Run every 30 minutes: 1) Am I excited? (warning sign) 2) Using celebration language? 3) Eager to move on? 4) Would I bet $1000?"

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED AS SEPARATE SECTION
**What I Included Instead**:
- Forbidden claims section (no celebration language)
- Checkpoint questions every 15 min
- Adversarial testing mentality
**Reason**: These principles cover the same ground without explicit meta-cognitive prompts
**Action Needed**: If you want explicit "excitement = warning sign" framing, I can add it

---

### 10. Verification Gates & Circuit Breakers
**Your Input**: 
```
VERIFICATION GATE: If you see ANY of these, STOP
CIRCUIT BREAKER CHECKS: After each phase, ask yourself...
```

**Status**: PARTIALLY INCLUDED
**What I Included**: 
- Testing checklist (must pass all before claiming success)
- Checkpoint questions
**What I Didn't Include**: Explicit "STOP" gates, circuit breaker terminology
**Reason**: Testing checklist achieves same goal. Can add explicit STOP gates if needed.
**Action Needed**: If you want hard STOP conditions, I can add them

---

### 11. Forbidden Actions Section
**Your Input**:
```
FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (Automatic Failure):
- Reverting to old imports
- Deleting files before Phase X
- etc.
```

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**Reason**: These were specific to a different project (SDK migration). This project has different forbidden actions.
**What I Included Instead**: 
- "NO LAZY IMPLEMENTATIONS" section
- Specific examples for this project (don't call litellm directly, don't use max_tokens, etc.)
**Action Needed**: If you want a formal "FORBIDDEN ACTIONS" section for this project, tell me what should be forbidden

---

### 12. Anti-Patterns Section with Recent Examples
**Your Input**:
```
## HOW I JUST FAILED (Update after each session)
❌ WRONG: "Complete - 100% Success"
✅ RIGHT: "Production verified. Semantic validation: UNKNOWN"
```

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED
**What I Included Instead**:
- Examples in "Forbidden Claims" section
- Adversarial testing examples
**Reason**: "Recent failure" section requires manual updates after each session. Examples in principles section serve same educational purpose.
**Action Needed**: If you want session-specific failure tracking, I can add it

---

### 13. Hallucination Check / Assumption Check
**Your Input**:
```
ASSUMPTION CHECK:
Before abandoning ANY part of plan:
1. Test assumption with actual code
2. Show exact error message  
3. Try at least 3 different approaches
```

**Status**: NOT INCLUDED AS SEPARATE SECTION
**What I Included Instead**: 
- Checkpoint question: "What am I assuming without evidence?"
- Evidence hierarchy (only command output counts)
**Reason**: Checkpoint questions catch assumptions. Can add explicit "test before abandoning" rule.
**Action Needed**: If you want explicit "never abandon without testing" rule, I can add it

---

## What I DID Include (Summary)

### From Your Feedback
✅ **Adversarial testing mentality** - Top priority, explicitly stated
✅ **Evidence hierarchy** - Only command output counts
✅ **Forbidden claims** - No "success!" without proof
✅ **Timeouts = failures** - Explicit statement
✅ **Entry point testing** - Must use user-facing entry points
✅ **No emojis** - Plain text only
✅ **Archive strategy** - Dated folders with README
✅ **Purpose of CLAUDE.md** - At top of file
✅ **Long-term vision** - Big picture context
✅ **Permanent vs Temporary sections** - Clearly separated
✅ **Directory structure** - Complete file organization
✅ **python-dotenv requirement** - Always use load_dotenv()
✅ **15-minute checkpoints** - Stop and answer 4 questions
✅ **Scope declaration** - Required before starting
✅ **Fail-fast and loud** - Extensive logging requirements

### Original to This Implementation
✅ **STATUS.md** - Quick lookup for component status
✅ **PATTERNS.md** - Copy-paste code templates
✅ **3-file system** - Separation of concerns
✅ **"What This DOES NOT Test"** - Explicit limitations
✅ **Granular action breakdown** - Next 3 actions with success criteria
